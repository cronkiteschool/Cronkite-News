</div></div><p><span style="font-size: 13px;">WASHINGTON &#8211; Most members of Arizona&#8217;s congressional delegation said they found something to like in President Barack Obama&#8217;s State of the Union address Tuesday &#8211; and some areas where they thought it came up short.</span></p>
<p>The speech was Obama&#8217;s sixth, and his first before a Congress where both chambers are controlled by Republicans. The hour-long address was interrupted 76 times by mostly Democratic applause, and once by Republicans after the president noted that he has run his last campaign &#8211; causing the president to ad lib that he &#8220;won them both&#8221; in response to their clapping.</p>
<p>The reaction from Arizona lawmakers was mostly mixed, with many reacting like Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., who said he saw &#8220;highs and lows&#8221; in the speech.</p>
<p>For Flake, the president&#8217;s commitment to normalizing relations with Cuba was among the good, while his talk of raising taxes was definitely among the bad.</p>
<p>Freshman Rep. Martha McSally, R-Tucson, was &#8220;one of the first people on my feet&#8221; in response to the president&#8217;s call to hire veterans. But she added that her district has not seen the economic recovery the president boasted about in his speech.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s up to him to put his money where his mouth is and change the tenor&#8221; of debate in Washington, McSally said after watching her first State of the Union address as a member of Congress.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/01/20/remarks-president-barack-obama-prepared-delivery-state-union-address" target="_blank">Obama&#8217;s speech</a> focused mostly on economic issues, touting some of his accomplishments &#8211; including a lower unemployment rate than before the beginning of the financial crisis &#8211; and suggesting more solutions that focus on &#8220;middle-class economics.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That means helping folks afford childcare, college, healthcare, a home, retirement -Â  and my budget will address each of these issues, lowering the taxes of working families and putting thousands of dollars back into their pockets each year,&#8221; Obama said.</p>
<p>He asked Congress to focus on technology and infrastructure that support &#8220;21st century business.&#8221; This means &#8220;modern ports, stronger bridges, faster trains and the fastest Internet,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Obama took a few jabs at the new Republican majority and threatened to veto legislation that would undo some of the biggest Democratic victories of the past six years.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t put the security of families at risk by taking away their health insurance, or unraveling the new rules on Wall Street, or refighting past battles on immigration when we&#8217;ve got a system to fix,&#8221; Obama said. &#8220;And if a bill comes to my desk that tries to do any of these things, it will earn my veto.&#8221;</p>
<p>But mostly, he encouraged Congress to find a way to work together.</p>
<p>&#8220;A better politics is one where we debate without demonizing each other; where we talk issues, and values, and principles and facts, rather than &#8216;gotcha&#8217; moments or trivial gaffes or fake controversies that have nothing to do with people&#8217;s daily lives,&#8221; Obama said.</p>
<p>The president was cautious when discussing foreign policy, warning against &#8220;rash decisions&#8221; and &#8220;reacting to headlines instead of using our heads.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., issued a joint statement praising the president&#8217;s support of free trade and of legislation related to cybersecurity. But they went on to criticize Obama&#8217;s foreign policy, particularly his handling of terrorism in the Middle East.</p>
<p>&#8220;American leadership is clearly not &#8216;smarter&#8217; under President Obama,&#8221; the statement said. &#8220;It is dangerously absent.&#8221;</p>
<p>But freshman Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Phoenix, said he was surprised about how forceful Obama was about Islamist fighters in Syria and Iraq. He said the president gave &#8220;a great speech, one of the better ones I&#8217;ve heard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He laid a really good vision and opportunity for the middle class that has been lacking the past six years,&#8221; Gallego said. &#8220;The president laid out a good plan for the child-care tax credit, and community college to help the working-class families.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Gallego noted that &#8220;while the president touched on&#8221; the issue of immigration reform, &#8220;it could have used more attention.&#8221;</p>
<p>Flake criticized the president for his immigration rhetoric, saying that &#8220;other than sticking fingers at each other, we need a border bill that deals with those who are here now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Phoenix, said she was disappointed that Obama did not specifically address the issues with Veterans Affairs services in Phoenix and the nation, noting that VA &#8220;reform is moving slowly&#8221; and that many veterans are still &#8220;waiting for the care that they deserve.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The lack of the president&#8217;s focus on the VA affects Arizona,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>But Sinema was pleased to hear Obama&#8217;s proposals for workplace flexibility and for no-cost community colleges, which she said would allow &#8220;young adults to graduate without debt.&#8221;</p>
<p>To Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Prescott, the president&#8217;s domestic promises were &#8220;the same song, it&#8217;s just a different date.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What the people want is very similar to what the ladies of the household want. They want a secured America, a healthy economy. They want a healthy family, and they want the rule of law,&#8221; Gosar said. &#8220;This president thinks government is the answer, and as Ronald Reagan would say, government is the problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sinema said the president&#8217;s speech alone would not determine whether this Congress will find the common ground he asked for.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think the president&#8217;s speech sets the stage either way,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I think Congress gets to make that decision.&#8221;</p>
