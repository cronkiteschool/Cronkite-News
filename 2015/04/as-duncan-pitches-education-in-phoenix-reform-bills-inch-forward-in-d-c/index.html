</div></div><p>WASHINGTON &#8211; As Education Secretary Arne Duncan was in Phoenix to discuss the future of education Tuesday, experts in Washington offered hope for the future of a massive federal schools act &#8211; although they had differing visions of what a final bill should look like.</p>
<p>Both sides say there is &#8220;an appetite&#8221; to finally reauthorize the 50-year-old Elementary and Secondary <a href="http://www.ed.gov/esea" target="_blank">Education Act</a> &#8211; known since 2002 as the <a href="http://www2.ed.gov/nclb/landing.jhtml" target="_blank">No Child</a> Left Behind Act &#8211; which expired in 2007. Even though the act expired eight years ago, states have continued to receive federal funding for their schools.</p>
<p>While they hope to reauthorize the bill, most agree that the No Child Left Behind is in need of a face-lift.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think both sides of the aisle right now recognize that No Child Left Behind is not working,&#8221; said Lindsey Burke, Will Skillman Fellow in Education Policy for the Heritage Foundation. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t work well for schools, it doesn&#8217;t work well for teachers and for students, so something needs to be done.&#8221;</p>
<p>Catherine Brown, vice president of education policy for the Center for American Progress, agreed that it was time to reauthorize and revamp the act.</p>
<p>But where Burke wants less of a federal presence in education policy, Brown said her center hopes for reauthorization that maintains a &#8220;strong system for low-performing schools,&#8221; while also focusing on early-childhood education and investment in teacher capacity.</p>
<p>Congress is making progress &#8211; in fits and starts.</p>
<p>The House Committee on Education and the Workforce in February approved the Student Success Act, a reauthorization proposal that would have put more decision-making authority in the hands of states. <a href="https://www.congress.gov/114/bills/hr5/BILLS-114hr5rh.pdf" target="_blank">The bill</a> was debated on the House floor, but put on hold before it could come up for a vote by the full House.</p>
<p>Brown said the House bill &#8220;took some important steps backwards,&#8221; saying it would shift money away from low-income communities.</p>
<p>&#8220;It also contained a lot of provisions to free up federal requirements so that states would have tremendous flexibility in what they did and how they served students who are poor,&#8221; Brown said. &#8220;And we recognize that states and localities have a role to play, but we would like to see strong federal backstops so that students, particularly low-income, minority, disadvantaged students, don&#8217;t get left behind again.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Burke said she didn&#8217;t think the Student Success Act gave enough control back to states &#8211; citing the need for a provision that would allow states to completely opt-out and &#8220;put its money toward any lawful education purpose under state law.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It does represent, in its current form, a real missed opportunity for conservatives to restore state and local control of education,&#8221; she said of the House measure.</p>
<p>Burke said her group would also like to see a limit on mandates and required programs, and have federal education dollars be &#8220;portable&#8221; &#8211; letting funding follow students to private schools.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think in an ideal world what we would like to see is states having control over the dollars that we currently spend,&#8221; Burke said.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, meanwhile, the chairman and ranking minority member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee unveiled their own <a href="http://www.help.senate.gov/imo/media/S_EveryChildAchievesActof2015.pdf" target="_blank">bipartisan agreement</a> aimed at fixing No Child Left Behind.</p>
<p>Sens. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., and Patty Murray, D-Wash., said in a <a href="http://www.alexander.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/pressreleases?ID=329fb494-0ad2-4eeb-b556-3e1d6346728b" target="_blank">joint statement</a> that their Every Child Achieves Act of 2015 &#8220;would fix the problems with No Child Left Behind, while keeping successful provisions&#8221; according to a joint statement.</p>
<p>Alexander said in the statement that the proposal &#8220;continues important measures of academic progress&#8221; but leaves it to local officials to decide what to do with those assessments to improve teacher and student performance. That should &#8220;produce fewer and more appropriate tests,&#8221; he said. An overemphasis on testing has been a key criticism of No Child Left Behind.</p>
<p>The Senate proposal was welcomed by American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten.</p>
<p>She said in a statement that the bill &#8220;restores ESEA&#8217;s original intent of mitigating poverty and addressing education equity&#8221; while moving away from &#8220;increasingly counterproductive focus on sanctions, high-stakes tests, federalized teacher evaluations and school closings.&#8221;</p>
