      <p>When Mark Larson first required a kidney transplant in 1984, obtaining one was relatively simple because his sister was willing to donate one of hers.</p>
<p>When that kidney failed three years later, he spent five years on a waiting list – and undergoing dialysis – before receiving one from a deceased donor.</p>
<p>Larson said the process was grueling, including one false start when he returned from vacation only to find out that a kidney he was supposed to receive wasn&#8217;t going to work out.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was disappointed, and having gone through what I&#8217;ve already gone through, I just said, &#8216;OK, this is one more bump in the road,&#8217;&#8221; he said. &#8220;You just gotta keep a good attitude, which I always believe is a good way to live my life.&#8221;</p>
<p>As of April 30, 2,011 Arizonans were on the waiting list for kidneys, which are by far the organ in greatest demand, according to the <a href="http://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/converge/latestData/stateData.asp?type=state">Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network</a>.</p>
<p>There have never been more registered organ donors in Arizona – more than 2.5 million – thanks in large to a change in 2006 allowing people to register as organ donors when receiving driver&#8217;s licenses, according to the <a href="http://www.dnaz.org/Home.aspx">Donor Network of Arizona</a>. Ninety-five percent of donors registered through the Arizona Department of Transportation&#8217;s Motor Vehicle Division.</p>
<p>Even so, a little more than half of Arizona&#8217;s adult population is registered to donate organs, eyes and tissue.</p>
<p>Without a live donor willing to offer a kidney, patients usually endure years-long long waits for kidneys because obtaining organs for donation involves more than just having a large pool of potential donors. </p>
<p>Donors must be legally declared brain dead, must be 70 or younger and must die in a hospital. They can&#8217;t have had diseases such as cancers that affect certain organs or have HIV, tuberculosis or other infections that could be transmitted through organs.</p>
<p>About 1 percent of people pass away in a manner that allows them to be an organ donor, according to the Donor Network of Arizona. </p>
<p>In 2014, 129 Arizonans died while waiting for a lifesaving transplant, and 95 of those people were waiting for a kidney, according to the Donor Network of Arizona.</p>
<p>Dr. Alfredo Fabrega, medical director of Banner &#8211; University Medical Center Phoenix&#8217;s transplant program, said patients are on the waitlist for kidneys for about five years.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s always a shortage,&#8221; he said. </p>
<p>&#8220;Patients survive longer on dialysis, and sometimes if you have heart failure or liver failure they don&#8217;t survive that long,&#8221; Fabrega added. &#8220;So you don&#8217;t have five-, 10-year waiting times for livers because you wouldn&#8217;t live that long.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kidney disease is the ninth-leading cause of death in the United States, and about 31 million people in the nation have chronic kidney disease, according to the American Kidney Fund.</p>
<p>Jacqueline Keidel, spokeswoman for the Donor Network of Arizona, said people on dialysis receive three to four treatment s a week.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re alive and living, but it&#8217;s a very difficult life to live,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Leslie Brown, director of administration of the <a href="https://azkidney.org/">National Kidney Foundation of Arizona</a>, said there may not be as many donors as there could be because people don&#8217;t often visit the Motor Vehicle Division offices, as an Arizona driver&#8217;s license is good until age 65. Drivers in some other states must renew after several years.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our licenses just happen to last so many years that you don&#8217;t really need to go in and get a new license and get asked that question for a long time,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>In 2013, 68 percent of transplants in the U.S. were from deceased donors and 32 percent from living donors, according to the <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajt.13194/epdf">2013 Organ Procurement Transplantation Network / Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients annual data report</a>.</p>
<p>Fabrega, medical director of Banner &#8211; University Medical Center Phoenix, said donations from living donors are becoming more popular, but he said most people aren&#8217;t aware of the opportunity or don&#8217;t want to donate unless it&#8217;s somebody they know.</p>
<p>Marcel Pincince, director of donor family and advocate services at the Donor Network of Arizona, said families heal from the decision to donate a loved one&#8217;s organs because they have a more positive story to share.</p>
<p>&#8220;Usually when they come to the hospital they only have a terrible story to tell: the story of the death of their loved one,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And now they have another story to tell that their loved one went on.&#8221;</p>
<p>Larson is able to travel again and serve as president of the  <a href="http://www.maricopaaudubon.org/default.html">Maricopa Audubon Society.</a> Now a volunteer with the Donor Network of Arizona, he said he loves working with the organization that gave him another chance at life.</p>
<p>&#8220;In this life, sometimes terrible things happen … but this is a way to make something good come out of something tragic,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Larson said he keeps in touch with his donor family, and to this day his donor&#8217;s mother, Mercy Villegas, calls him &#8220;hijo,&#8221; Spanish for son.</p>
<p>Villegas&#8217; son Jess Villegas Jr. was married two months before he died from a brain aneurysm, Larson said. </p>
<p>Six months after Larson received his kidney transplant and wrote a letter to the donor family, he said he heard from Mercy Villegas. They have kept in touch since.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even though she knows in her mind that she saved six peoples&#8217; lives, I&#8217;m the only one she&#8217;s heard from, so I&#8217;m in her heart,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And she&#8217;s in my heart.&#8221;</p>
