<div class="newswatch_story">
<p>WASHINGTON &#8211; When Sen. John McCain announced his intention this week to run for election to a sixth term in 2016, he said he was ready for a fight from any challengers who might want to take him on.</p>
<p>He may well get that fight. Political analysts say McCain will almost surely face an expensive campaign with challengers likely from both the left and the right.</p>
<p>Several members of the state&#8217;s congressional delegation have been mentioned as possible challengers and state Sen. Kelli Ward, R-Lake Havasu City, has formed an exploratory committee as she considers a run.</p>
<p>The biggest challenge is likely to come from the right, with conservatives like Ward questioning McCain&#8217;s ideological credentials while right-leaning campaign groups are already pledging to raise funds for a credible challenger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look, we&#8217;ve done polling, a credible candidate has a very solid chance of beating Senator McCain,&#8221; said Ken Cuccinelli, president of the Senate Conservatives Fund.</p>
<p>Finding that credible candidate is the first step.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know there are plenty of names who have surfaced, and will surface, but who knows if any of them are going to actually run,&#8221; said Stu Rothenberg, a political analyst and columnist for Roll Call.</p>
<p>Rothenberg and others said one thing that might keep potential challengers out of the race is money.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll need to raise many millions of dollars to challenge him,&#8221; Rothenberg said.</p>
<p>McCain had just over $2 million on hand at the end of 2014, the most recent reporting period with the Federal Election Commission. First-quarter fundraising numbers are not due to the FEC until next week, but Politico reported this week that McCain added another $1.6 million in the first quarter of this year.</p>
<p>Analysts say that&#8217;s a fraction of what McCain can raise &#8211; but also a fraction of what he&#8217;s going to need for the race.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s not unlikely that he will need something in the vicinity of what he spent the last time, which was more than $20 million,&#8221; Viveca Novak, spokeswoman for the Center for Responsive Politics said this week.</p>
<p>&#8220;He had some of that leftover from his (2008) presidential campaign, this time he&#8217;s going to have to raise it,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Ward, who was not allowed to raise money during the just-ended legislative session, said she is focusing heavily on raising the funds that would be key to any challenge.</p>
<p>Cuccinelli said the money is there for the right candidate.</p>
<p>&#8220;There will be more than enough money to go toe-to-toe, getting message out for a conservative challenger,&#8221; Cuccinelli said. &#8220;I have little doubt that <a href="http://www.senateconservatives.com/" target="_blank">SCF</a> (Senate Conservatives Fund) will bring well in excess of seven figures to a race like this with a credible opponent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Few of McCain&#8217;s latest <a href="http://www.azsos.gov/elections/voter-registration-historical-election-data" target="_blank">re-election bids</a> could be called close. He faced no primary opponent in 2004 and won the 1998 primary 99.67 percent of the vote. A 2010 challenge from former Rep. J.D. Hayworth ended with McCain taking 56 percent of the primary vote to Hayworth&#8217;s 32 percent.</p>
<p>McCain won his last three Senate elections with 69 percent, 77 percent and 59 percent of the vote.</p>
<p>In his <a href="http://www.mccain.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/speeches?ID=9b95bbb2-aeed-4dfc-be44-7452f76d050a" target="_blank">re-election announcement</a>, McCain touted everything from his work to protect veterans to his ability to help get a cattle-crossing station reopened in Douglas.</p>
<p>Now chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, McCain talked about his work to protect military facilities in the state. He cited his repeated warnings about the Obama administration&#8217;s &#8220;feckless policy&#8221; of &#8220;leading from behind,&#8221; which he said has led to problems in Iran, Russia, Syria and other parts of the globe.</p>
<p>He did not mention his work as one of the eight senators, along with Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., who designed a bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform bill that passed the Senate but later stalled in the House.</p>
<p>Cuccinelli said McCain&#8217;s work on immigration is just one example of how he has moved away from the conservative principles Arizona voters want.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is one of the most aggressive, anti-conservative Republicans in the country,&#8221; Cuccinelli said. &#8220;He takes a baseball bat to conservatives and gives kisses and hugs to Democrats.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s one reason Ward said she is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Kelli-Ward-for-US-Senate-2016/1374687346182248" target="_blank">even considering</a> what she concedes would be a &#8220;David and Goliath situation&#8221; against McCain. She said voters &#8220;want people who are going to be representing them, who aren&#8217;t afraid to rock the boat in Washington, D.C.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of people are out there who are saying it&#8217;s time for positive, passionate, principled conservatives to start leading our country, and so that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m even considering this race,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>For his part, McCain said after his Tuesday re-election announcement that he will be ready for any and all challengers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I expect as in every <a href="http://johnmccain.com/" target="_blank">election campaign</a> a tough fight,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve never minded a good fight and I will look forward to another one if it&#8217;s necessary.&#8221;</p>
