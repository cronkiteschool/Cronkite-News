</div></div><p>WASHINGTON &#8211; Justices peppered both sides with questions Tuesday as the Supreme Court grappled with a case that could legalize same-sex marriage in every state, two years after overturning a federal ban on such unions.</p>
<p>The justices this time were considering two questions: Whether state bans on same-sex marriage are constitutional and whether states that do not allow the marriages must recognize those performed in other states.</p>
<p>The issue drew hundreds of protesters who rallied outside the court, while inside the court a man was removed about halfway through the 2.5-hour hearing for screaming, &#8220;If you support gay marriage, you&#8217;ll burn in hell. It&#8217;s an abomination of God.&#8221;</p>
<p>The court appeared to struggle with the question, with several justices asking whether it is the court&#8217;s role to change the definition of marriage.</p>
<p>&#8220;This definition has been with us for millennia, and it&#8217;s very difficult for the court to say, &#8216;Oh, well, we know better,&#8217;&#8221; said Justice Anthony Kennedy, the expected swing vote on the court.</p>
<p>But Kennedy later expressed concerns about excluding gay and lesbian couples from marriage, adding that it confers &#8220;dignity&#8221; on them.</p>
<p>The court <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-307_6j37.pdf" target="_blank">in 2013 overturned</a> the federal Defense of Marriage Act, which said marriage had to be between a man and a woman. That sparked a string lower court rulings overturning state bans on same-sex marriage, including an October ruling by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals led to rejection of <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/243375766/Connolly-Et-Al-v-Brewer-Et-Al" target="_blank">the ban in Arizona</a> and other states.</p>
<p>Since the October ruling, advocates estimate that 600 couples in Arizona married and many more had marriages that were performed in other states recognized by Arizona.</p>
<p>Thirty-six states now recognize same-sex marriages. But four <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/14-556q1_7l48.pdf" target="_blank">states that do not</a> &#8211; Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky and Tennessee &#8211; were before the court Tuesday arguing that their voters should be allowed to decide the issue.</p>
<p>Justices picked up that argument.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you prevail here, there will be no more debate,&#8221; Chief Justice John Roberts said to Mary Bonauto, an attorney for one of the groups pushing for same-sex marriage. &#8220;Closing of debate can close minds, and it will have a consequence on how this new institution is accepted.</p>
<p>&#8220;People feel very differently about something if they have a chance to vote on it than if it&#8217;s imposed on them by the courts,&#8221; Roberts said.</p>
<p>John Bursch, a special assistant attorney general for Michigan, argued that it is a states&#8217; rights issue.</p>
<p>&#8220;This case isn&#8217;t about how to define marriage. It&#8217;s about who gets to decide that question,&#8221; Bursch said. &#8220;Is it the people acting through the democratic process, or is it the federal courts?&#8221;</p>
<p>But Justice Stephen Breyer said the issue must extend beyond states&#8217; rights. He questioned whether a certain group&#8217;s religious beliefs should be allowed to affect all same-sex couples.</p>
<p>&#8220;Certain religious groups do think it&#8217;s a sin, and I believe they sincerely think it. There&#8217;s no question about their sincerity, but is a purely religious reason on the part of some people sufficient?&#8221; Breyer asked.</p>
<p>Much of the debate on both questions of same-sex marriage centered on how it would affect children in same-sex and opposite-sex couples.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you change the definition of marriage to delink the idea that we&#8217;re binding children with their biological mom and dad, that has consequences,&#8221; Bursch said. He argued that allowing same-sex marriage would make the definition of marriage &#8220;more adult-centric and less child-centric.&#8221;</p>
<p>But his argument that allowing same-sex marriage would lead to fewer opposite-sex couples getting married, in turn leading to more children growing up without parents, didn&#8217;t hold water with many of the justices.</p>
<p>Justice Sonia Sotomayor said marriage doesn&#8217;t bind children to parents &#8220;on any level&#8221; in the way Bursch suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;(In) how many married couples do fathers with the benefits or the requirements of marriage walk away from their children?&#8221; Sotomayor asked. &#8220;How does withholding marriage from one group, same-sex couples, increase the value to the other group?&#8221;</p>
<p>Even Kennedy expressed doubt over the idea that excluding same-sex couples from marriage would have a better influence on children.</p>
<p>&#8220;You had some premise that only opposite-sex couples can have a bonding with the child. That was very interesting, but it&#8217;s just a wrong premise,&#8221; Kennedy said.</p>
<p>The justices were less divided on the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/14-556q2_2dp3.pdf" target="_blank">second question</a> of whether states banning same-sex marriage must recognize marriage licenses from states that allow it.</p>
<p>Tennessee Associate Solicitor General Joseph Whalen argued that requiring states to recognize same-sex marriage licenses from other states would allow &#8220;each state &#8230; to essentially legislate for every other state.&#8221;</p>
<p>But even the typically more conservative judges wavered on this issue.</p>
<p>&#8220;What about (the Constitution&#8217;s) Article IV?&#8221; Justice Antonin Scalia asked. &#8220;&#8216;Full faith and credit shall be given in each state to the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of every other state.&#8217; Now, why doesn&#8217;t that apply? Public acts? It would include the act of marrying people, I assume.&#8221;</p>
<p>Justices pointed out that the first and the second question would be difficult to untangle from one another.</p>
<p>&#8220;You acknowledge that if the state loses on the first question, then the state also loses on the second question?&#8221; Justice Elena Kagan asked Whalen.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; Whalen responded.</p>
<p>The court is expected to rule on the cases before it recesses in July.</p>
