</div></div><p>WASHINGTON &#8211; Arizona Reps. Ron Barber and Ann Kirkpatrick touted their designation this week as being among the Democrats most likely to buck their party in congressional votes.</p>
<p>For Barber and Kirkpatrick, the ranking &#8211; they were in the top 10 &#8211; reflects the will of their constituents, which is somewhere between the Republican and Democratic parties on issues.</p>
<p>But one political scientist said it&#8217;s more like being &#8220;between a rock and a hard place.&#8221;</p>
<p>A <a href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/daily/matheson-amash-split-from-parties-most-often-20130328" target="_blank">National Journal analysis</a> of 86 votes in this Congress found that Barber voted against the party 16 times and Kirkpatrick 15 times, making them the fifth- and eighth-most contrary Democrats in the House.</p>
<p>The average House member split with his or her party on seven votes, by contrast.</p>
<p>&#8220;The main thing is they (Barber and Kirkpatrick) both represent swing districts,&#8221; said Barbara Norander, a professor at the University of Arizona School of Government and Public Policy.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is an even match between Republicans and Democrats. They have to keep their Republican constituents in mind,&#8221; Norander said.</p>
<p>The National Journal said the lawmakers on its top-10 list represented closely divided districts like Barber&#8217;s 2nd District, in southeast Arizona, and Kirkpatrick&#8217;s 1st District, which sprawls over much of the north and east of the state. The New York Times <a href="http://elections.nytimes.com/2012/ratings/house" target="_blank">listed their districts</a> as among the most-competitive in the nation during the 2012 election.</p>
<p>Norander said independent voter registration and more competitive redistricting have accentuated the state&#8217;s greater diversity.</p>
<p>Kirkpatrick and Barber said they are simply voting with their constituents, who care more about issues than party labels.</p>
<p><a href="http://kirkpatrick.house.gov/" target="_blank">Kirkpatrick</a>, of Flagstaff, said her votes have more to do with the size and diversity of her district than her own party affiliation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I always put my constituents first,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I just really listen to the district. It&#8217;s where I grew up.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://barber.house.gov/" target="_blank">Barber</a>, of Tucson, said he is just making good on his campaign promise to &#8220;try to find common ground and accomplish things across the aisle.&#8221; He acknowledged that his district is competitive, but also said the number of registered independents is rapidly growing.</p>
<p>&#8220;For some reason they have decided not to align themselves with either major party,&#8221; Barber said of independents. &#8220;What they have seen from the parties is a gridlock.&#8221;</p>
<p>Arizonans have always been independent thinkers and they don&#8217;t like to limit themselves to a single party mindset, said Barber, who has lived in the state since his boyhood when Arizona was predominantly Democratic.</p>
<p>&#8220;For me it is not about being a member of the party, it is about back home,&#8221; he said. &#8220;One of the things I love about Arizona is the independent thinking residents have.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since Barber&#8217;s boyhood, the state has swung from Democratic to heavily Republican and is now slowly moving from a red state back toward a blue state.</p>
<p>James Thurber, the director of American University&#8217;s Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies, said the state is indeed becoming purple, but he thinks Kirkpatrick&#8217;s and Barber&#8217;s voting patterns have more to do with getting re-elected in a still-red state.</p>
<p>&#8220;Their key constituency is more conservative,&#8221; Thurber said. &#8220;They are between a rock and a hard place.&#8221;</p>
<p>Their splits with the party can hurt how they are seen by Democratic leaders in Washington and by more-liberal voters back home, he said.</p>
<p>Thurber said Arizona is on &#8220;shifting sands,&#8221; as more Latinos vote and the parties become more polarized. That makes moderate Democrats and Republicans an &#8220;endangered species,&#8221; and Kirkpatrick and Barber may not be able to vote across the aisle as often, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hard to lead, it&#8217;s hard to persuade your constituents to go a certain way when they are ahead of you,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>An Arizona <a href="http://www.azgop.org/" target="_blank">Republican Party</a> spokesman said both lawmakers are Democratic at heart and that they only vote Republican in &#8220;trivial areas.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;These folks are both in very competitive districts,&#8221; said Tim Sifert. &#8220;That tells you why they are playing the political game.&#8221;</p>
<p>But an Arizona <a href="http://azdem.org/" target="_blank">Democratic Party</a> spokesman said their votes just show that &#8220;the Democratic Party is really the party of the big tent.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;100 percent of us are not going to agree 100 percent of the time,&#8221; said Frank Camacho, the spokesman.</p>
<p>The competitiveness of their districts definitely influence Barber&#8217;s and Kirkpatrick&#8217;s votes, he said. But in Arizona, &#8220;the vast majority is in the vast middle,&#8221; Camacho said.</p>
<p>&#8220;On the basic core issues that define Democrats, I think we stand together on that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think there is anything wrong with them voting their conscience.&#8221;</p>
