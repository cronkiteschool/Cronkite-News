      <p>WASHINGTON &#8211; For a couple of hours this week, it looked like the Senate would give Alex Miller a chance to relax.</p>
<p>Miller, an Arizona State University senior, faces the possibility that she will have to pay an extra $1,000 this year for her college loan, after a July 1 deadline to keep loan rates from doubling passed without congressional action.</p>
<p>It looked like the Senate had come up with a bipartisan plan Wednesday, according to published reports. But any hopes of a deal were dashed a day later, the reports said, when budget analysts said the plan would add $22 billion to the deficit.</p>
<p>There is still hope that Congress can reach a deal and make it retroactive to July 1, when rates on federally subsidized Stafford loans went from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent.</p>
<p>Until then, Miller &#8211; and as many as 450,000 other students in Arizona &#8211; watch and wait.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a little scary&#8221; that lawmakers cannot reach a deal on something that Miller says is &#8220;so very very important.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Arizona Public Interest Research Group estimates that the higher rate would cost the typical student an extra $902 a year. It said the average student in the state has about $19,950 in accumulated debt.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s going to have a really negative impact on students&#8217; ability to stay in school and graduate in a timely manner,&#8221; said Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Phoenix, of the doubled rate.</p>
<p>Sinema, who has taught at Arizona State for 11 years, said most of her students have at least one loan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Almost all of them have a student loan that they&#8217;ve taken out at some point in their career, if not through their entire career,&#8221; Sinema said.</p>
<p>But financial aid adviser Mark Kantrowitz said that while a higher rate will certainly hit students, it likely will not keep them from going to college or &#8220;cause students to drop out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not the end of the world, yet it&#8217;s certainly an increase in their costs,&#8221; said Kantrowitz, the publisher of Edvisors.com. He noted that many students have more than just a Stafford loan, which will help spread the pain.</p>
<p>But Serena Unrein of <a href="http://www.arizonapirg.org/sites/pirg/files/resources/Student Loan Debt in Arizona.pdf" target="_blank">Arizona PIRG said</a> &#8220;student loans should make college more affordable for a student.&#8221; A higher loan rate &#8220;discourages Arizonans from getting a college education,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>While it may not be &#8220;the end of the world&#8221; now, higher rates will have a real impact over time, said Rory O&#8217;Sullivan, policy and research director at Young Invincibles.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re talking about an extra $1,000 per year per loan &#8211; that&#8217;s going to add up quickly&#8221; for Americans who already have more than $1 trillion in total student loan debt, he said.</p>
<p>Congress has faced this issue before: When <a href="http://studentaid.ed.gov/" target="_blank">the Stafford loan</a> rate was set to double last summer, lawmakers simply extended the rate to this July 1.</p>
<p>While some lawmakers wanted another extension this year, the White House and House leaders had other plans.</p>
<p>The House in May passed a measure that would have kept subsidized loan rates from doubling &#8211; for now &#8211; by tying them to the 10-year Treasury note rate, plus 2.5 percentage points.</p>
<p>That plan was opposed by most House Democrats in a <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll183.xml" target="_blank">221-198 vote</a> and was a non-starter in the Senate.</p>
<p>&#8220;We would be talking about an interest rate that would go up or down depending on the Treasury notes,&#8221; said Rep. Ron Barber, D-Tucson. &#8220;That uncertainty I think makes it difficult for people to plan or even to know if they can afford to take out a loan.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sinema said <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-113hr1911eh/pdf/BILLS-113hr1911eh.pdf" target="_blank">the House plan</a> would be &#8220;worse than doing nothing&#8221; for students.</p>
<p>President Barack Obama had proposed tying loan rates to Treasury notes, but <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/05/31/fact-sheet-president-obama-fights-keep-interest-rates-doubling" target="_blank">his plan</a> would have fixed rates for the life of the loan. The White House estimates that roughly 7 million people could be affected nationally by the rate change.</p>
<p>The Senate tried Wednesday to simply extend the 3.4 percent rate. When that failed, negotiations began on the bipartisan plan &#8211; yet another version of the Treasury-note scheme, news reports said &#8211; but that fizzled Thursday.</p>
<p>Sinema could not predict this week whether Congress will reach a deal before its August recess.</p>
<p>&#8220;We may continue negotiations between Republicans and Democrats to find some compromise or middle ground,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But given what we&#8217;ve seen from Congress thus far, I wouldn&#8217;t hold my breath for that.&#8221;</p>
<p>She said she will continue to push for an extension of the old rate <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-113hr1876ih/pdf/BILLS-113hr1876ih.pdf" target="_blank">for four years</a>. That would give students and families &#8220;the ability to plan for their four-year undergraduate degree.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They should know what the rate&#8217;s going to be when they get done with school,&#8221; Sinema said.</p>
<p>Miller echoed those concerns about a floating loan rate tied to the markets.</p>
<p>&#8220;It makes me nervous,&#8221; said Miller, who has about $20,000 in debt. &#8220;For peace of mind as a student, that doesn&#8217;t make me feel comfortable at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the window for a solution gets smaller each day, Miller hopes students will contact lawmakers to make their voices heard.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is still very much this mindset in American politics that students don&#8217;t vote and that we don&#8217;t care about what&#8217;s happening in Congress,&#8221; Miller said. &#8220;That&#8217;s just absolutely not true . . . we just need to make more noise about it.&#8221;</p>
