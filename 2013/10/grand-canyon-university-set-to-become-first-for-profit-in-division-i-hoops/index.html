</div></div><p>PHOENIX – With a $40 million, 5,000-seat arena and Phoenix Suns&#8217; icon Dan Majerle as head coach, Grand Canyon University is set to become the first for-profit school to play NCAA Division I basketball.</p>
<p>As of July 1, the school left NCAA Division II status, accepting an invitation to join the Western Athletic Conference. That began a four-year waiting period to qualify for NCAA championships in any sport.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just a logical step for us,&#8221; said Keith Baker, Grand Canyon&#8217;s athletic director. &#8220;It&#8217;s something that we had envisioned several years back. Once that (invitation) came, we were at least prepared to start making the steps necessary in order to make it a reality.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the Pac-12 Conference and member Arizona State University have voiced concerns about the move, which applies to each of Grand Canyon&#8217;s 22 teams, including baseball, softball, volleyball and soccer, with 450 student athletes.</p>
<p>Grand Canyon, a private, Christian school, became for-profit and publicly traded in 2003. In addition to 8,500 students on its west Phoenix campus, the school has 47,000 online students.</p>
<p>In July, Pac-12 presidents and CEOs sent the NCAA a letter that, while not mentioning Grand Canyon, asked for further review of accepting for-profit schools. The letter cited &#8220;troubling reports&#8221; about how much attention and money for-profit schools commit to athletics and academics.</p>
<p>ASU President Michael M. Crow later told The Arizona Republic that he doesn&#8217;t believe in competing in athletics against a for-profit university. Phone messages and an email seeking comment through ASU&#8217;s media relations office weren&#8217;t returned by Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<p>Brian Mueller, Grand Canyon&#8217;s president and CEO, issued a news release at the time saying he had no quarrel with ASU and adding that the school has invested $300 million on classrooms, labs, dorms and athletic facilities over the past four years.</p>
<p>A Pac-12 spokesman referred a reporter to the letter and said conference officials had no further comment.</p>
<p>Baker, Grand Canyon&#8217;s athletic director, said almost all of the interactions he&#8217;s had with Pac-12 athletic directors and coaches are supportive of the move to Division I. The only Pac-12 team on the basketball team&#8217;s schedule this season is Utah.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re moving forward as if there&#8217;s not a controversy,&#8221; Baker said. &#8220;There&#8217;s lots of schools to play.&#8221;</p>
<p>He called Majerle&#8217;s hiring a &#8220;phenomenal&#8221; complement to the Division I move.</p>
<p>&#8220;It just really adds that little bit of significance to what we&#8217;re trying to do here overall,&#8221; Baker said.</p>
<p>The basketball team&#8217;s first game is a Nov. 1 home exhibition against UC San Diego.</p>
<p>Majerle, who left a job as Suns assistant coach in January, said heading a Division I program was a huge selling point.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to be able to compete at the highest level,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve done that in the NBA, and now in college there&#8217;s nothing better than being a Division I program.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Grand Canyon was successful at the Division II level, Majerle said the jump is going to be a challenge.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know we&#8217;ll compete, but I don&#8217;t know how much we&#8217;ll win right away,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a process.&#8221;</p>
<p>Junior guard Jerome Garrison, who graduated from Mountain Pointe High School in Phoenix, said the team has been practicing longer and harder in preparation for the move.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything&#8217;s just more intense,&#8221; Garrison said. &#8220;You have to be that way when you&#8217;re going to Division I because that&#8217;s going to be a fast-paced, strong, explosive game.&#8221;</p>
<p>Baker said the athletic department has hired more personnel to handle expanded duties and to improve academic support for athletes.</p>
<p>In addition to the basketball arena, which opened two years ago, the school built a $9 million student recreation center three years ago that doubles as a practice facility for the basketball, volleyball and wrestling teams. Grand Canyon also has made improvements to its baseball, softball and golf facilities, Baker said.</p>
<p>With his face plastered on billboards and aired on commercials, Majerle has been the focal point of Grand Canyon&#8217;s new marketing campaign.</p>
<p>This season marks the first time the school has  marketed season tickets to the general public rather than just students, alumni and staff, Baker said.</p>
<p>So far, the division jump has had a mixed impact on recruiting, he said.</p>
<p>Recruits value that the school now plays in Division I, he said, but the four years during which teams can&#8217;t compete for championships turns some off.</p>
<p>The move didn&#8217;t require GCU to add any new sports teams to comply with Title IX, which requires equal participation opportunities for both genders, Baker said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe one of the largest parts of our invitation was our broad-based offering of sports to begin with,&#8221; he said.</p>
