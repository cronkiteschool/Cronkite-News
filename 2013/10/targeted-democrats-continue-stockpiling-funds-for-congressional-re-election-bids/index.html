</div></div><p>WASHINGTON &#8211; With a year until the next election, Democratic freshmen in three competitive Arizona congressional districts are continuing to stockpile cash for their re-election bids, according to the latest campaign finance reports.</p>
<p>The Federal Election Commission said Reps. Kyrsten Sinema, Ron Barber and Ann Kirkpatrick had each raised at least $280,000 between July 1 and Sept. 30. No other member of the state&#8217;s congressional delegation raised even half that amount during the period.</p>
<p>While they raised more, the three also had more cash on hand than most of the rest of the delegation: Sinema had $781,602 on hand, Barber had $767,204 and Kirkpatrick had $652,652 in the bank.</p>
<p>Only Rep. Ed Pastor, D-Phoenix, had more campaign cash on hand, reporting $1.3 million in the bank as of Sept. 30.</p>
<p>&#8220;Having cash in hand is always a good thing,&#8221; said Barbara Norrander, a professor from the University of Arizona&#8217;s <a href="http://sgpp.arizona.edu/" target="_blank">School of Government</a> and Public Policy.</p>
<p>Sinema&#8217;s, Kirkpatrick&#8217;s and Barber&#8217;s districts have been targeted by the national Republican Party, and all three have been described as &#8220;seats in play&#8221; by the <a href="http://rothenbergpoliticalreport.com/ratings/house" target="_blank">Rothenberg Political Report</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Republicans identify Kirkpatrick, Sinema and Barber as vulnerable,&#8221; said Ruth Jones, a professor at Arizona State University&#8217;s <a href="http://pgs.clas.asu.edu/" target="_blank">School of Politics</a> and Global Studies.</p>
<p>All three already have legitimate challengers. Barber, in particular, was outraised in the quarter by Republican Martha McSally, who is seeking a rematch for the Tucson-based seat after narrowly losing to Barber in 2012. McSally reported raising $349,164 in the third quarter, more than any other challenger or any incumbent in the delegation.</p>
<p>&#8220;It means McSally is a credible challenger,&#8221; Norrander said of the fundraising. &#8220;She is facing an uphill battle and she has to raise more than the incumbent.&#8221;</p>
<p>But while McSally raised more, Barber still had almost twice as much cash on hand at the end of the quarter, the FEC said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rep. Barber has been having three strong quarters in a row, but it is only McSally&#8217;s first quarter, and candidates always raise more money in the first quarter,&#8221; said DJ Quinlan, executive director of the <a href="http://azdem.org/" target="_blank">Arizona Democratic Party</a>.</p>
<p>But <a href="http://www.azgop.org/" target="_blank">Arizona Republican Party</a> spokesman Tim Sifert said the party has confidence in the &#8220;great and competitive candidates&#8221; it is already fielding for 2014.</p>
<p>&#8220;Arizona is a very Republican state,&#8221; Sifert said. &#8220;The Republican party has bigger advantage in voter registration and voter turnout.&#8221;</p>
<p>He pointed to the multiple Republican challengers in the districts. They include relatively recent candidates like radio talk-show host Ed Martin, who is running against Barber, and Arizona House Speaker Andy Tobin, who hopes to challenge Kirkpatrick.</p>
<p>Because both challengers only recently declared their campaigns, neither has fundraising that shows up yet with the FEC.</p>
<p>Democrats expect Tobin to raise a lot of money, Quinlan said, as he &#8220;is someone a lot of people want to be friend of in Washington, D.C., and with a lot of special interest,&#8221; said Quinlan.</p>
<p>Sinema also faces several Republican challengers for her Phoenix-area seat. They include Wendy Rogers &#8211; who raised just under $120,000 in the last quarter and had $272,828 on hand &#8211; former NFL player Andrew Walter and 2012 GOP nominee Vernon Parker.</p>
<p>With so many Republican challengers, Quinlan sees an advantage for the Democrats.</p>
<p>&#8220;The three districts are moderate swing districts,&#8221; said Quinlan, who said challengers might go too far right in the primary to win in the general election.</p>
<p>And Jones said a harshly contested Republican primary could make it more difficult for the nominee to win the general election.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be more costly to have a stronger primary election competition than to have a nominal one,&#8221; said Jones, who said challengers &#8220;need save enough money to go up against the Democrats.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Sifert said he is confident the party can unite behind its nominees after the primary and win in the general.</p>
<p>&#8220;The only way that I can prove that point is going to be the day after the election,&#8221; he said.</p>
