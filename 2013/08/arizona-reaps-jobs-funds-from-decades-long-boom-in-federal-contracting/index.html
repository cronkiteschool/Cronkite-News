</div></div><p><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">WASHINGTON &#8211; Federal contract spending in Arizona grew more than three times faster than the national rate over the past 20 years, according to a Cronkite News Service analysis of government data.</span></p>
<p>Between 1992 and 2012, the value of federal contracts in Arizona rose from $2.4 billion to $14.2 billion, a 491 percent increase. Total federal contract <a href="http://usaspending.gov/" target="_blank">spending</a> in the same period rose 158 percent, from $199.8 billion to $517 billion.</p>
<p>The growth in contracts outpaced overall growth of the state economy, with federal contracting rising from 3 percent of Arizona&#8217;s economy in 1992 to more than 5.3 percent in 2012, according to <a href="http://bea.gov/regional/index.htm" target="_blank">Bureau of Economic Analysis</a> data.</p>
<p><a href="https://fpds.gov/fpdsng_cms/index.php" target="_blank">Federal contracting</a> is &#8220;one of the most important drivers of the state&#8217;s economy,&#8221; said Dennis Hoffman, a professor of economics at Arizona State University&#8217;s W.P. Carey School of Business.</p>
<p>&#8220;I just don&#8217;t know how you can avoid the simple arithmetic,&#8221; <a href="http://wpcarey.asu.edu/directory/people/profile.cfm?person=1039497" target="_blank">Hoffman</a> said said of the numbers. &#8220;These are private-sector jobs&#8221; supported by federal spending.</p>
<p>Contract jobs are a &#8220;boon&#8221; to towns like Mesa, where a Boeing plant produces Apache helicopters and brings &#8220;very high-paying jobs,&#8221; said Mayor Scott Smith.</p>
<p>Defense-related jobs like Boeing&#8217;s have always played a large part in federal contracts in the state, accounting for 77 percent to 92 percent of total Arizona contracts over the 20 years.</p>
<p>Defense contracts in Arizona grew 578 percent, from $1.9 billion to $12.9 billion. Only Kentucky and Nevada saw larger percentage increases in defense spending over the 20 years. Only Kentucky saw a higher increase in all federal contracts, growing 622 percent.</p>
<p>Nationally, defense contract spending rose 167 percent since 1992.</p>
<p>&#8220;Support for defense spending is bipartisan,&#8221; said Nick Schwellenbach, a senior fiscal policy analyst with the <a href="http://www.foreffectivegov.org/" target="_blank">Center for Effective Government</a>, a government watchdog group. &#8220;Nobody ever complains when government spends more on contracting.&#8221;</p>
<p>And contractors spread work out among congressional districts so it&#8217;s harder to cut, said Stephen Slivinski, a senior economist at the <a href="http://goldwaterinstitute.org/" target="_blank">Goldwater Institute</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Contractors have gotten very savvy,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>More than 150,000 Arizonans worked in defense contracting in 2012, fifth-highest among states, according to a report done for the <a href="http://armedservices.house.gov/index.cfm/files/serve?File_id=126226cd-bc54-4e4b-a9ec-1ea16e61a2dd" target="_blank">Aerospace Industries Association</a> of America last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;These jobs are one of the important drivers of the state&#8217;s economy,&#8221; Slivinski said.</p>
<p>Most of the growth is being driven by the expansion of high-tech manufacturing at defense firms such as Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, Boeing, General Dynamics, BAE Systems and other companies in Arizona, said Hoffman.</p>
<p>Boeing and BAE Systems did not return calls seeking comment on the numbers, while Raytheon and Lockheed Martin declined comment.</p>
<p>Rep. <a href="http://www.pastor.house.gov/" target="_blank">Ed Pastor</a>, D-Phoenix, who took office in 1992, has seen the growth first-hand. He said it was natural for Arizona firms to get defense contracts because they began with a solid base.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you take all the factors, you begin to see that because Arizona companies were providing services and equipment (for conflicts), it was natural for them to get increased contracts,&#8221; Pastor said.</p>
<p>Pastor said Arizona companies in the 1990s were providing weapons for fighting in Bosnia and the Balkans, and have continued to do so for current wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.</p>
<p>Schwellenbach said the current wars have played a huge role.</p>
<p>&#8220;The spigot of defense spending opened, especially after 9/11,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Demand is a key factor in how Arizona companies respond to the &#8220;tempo&#8221; of spending from the Pentagon, said Rob Doolittle, a spokesman for <a href="http://www.generaldynamics.com/" target="_blank">General Dynamics</a>, which has facilities in Scottsdale and Tempe.</p>
<p>&#8220;When defense activity levels go up, purchases of General Dynamics-provided equipment and services that support those operations also increase,&#8221; he said in an e-mailed statement.</p>
<p>Despite the past growth, many defense-oriented companies are diversifying into other areas, such as service-centered contracts, including healthcare and information technology. Schwellenbach said that trend has been going on for 15 years.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of the more traditional defense contractors have been buying smaller, non-traditional contractors,&#8221; Schwellenbach said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The big contractors right now are not doing too badly,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That doesn&#8217;t mean they won&#8217;t be hurt&#8221; by future reductions in spending.</p>
<p>Economists worry that the reliance on defense contracts might affect the state&#8217;s ability to manage any downturns in Pentagon spending, especially after the recent drawdowns of troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you put all your eggs in one basket, your economy&#8217;s going to be lopsided,&#8221; Slivinski said. &#8220;I think we should be worried about the lopsided nature of the Arizona economy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hoffman agreed, saying that while Arizona is a &#8220;net beneficiary&#8221; of government spending, such spending is not sustainable over time.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t know what the economy is going to look like in the future,&#8221; Slivinski said. He said state lawmakers should work toward helping the state &#8220;diversify&#8221; the type of industries it attracts.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you have a diversified economy, you can weather&#8221; economic ebbs and flows in defense spending, he said.</p>
<p>Smith agreed that while defense contracts are &#8220;important to our economy, we&#8217;re subject to changes in spending&#8221; if the Pentagon cuts back.</p>
<p>&#8220;What contractors want is certainty&#8221; in the contracting process, Smith said.</p>
<p>Still, even with budget battles in Washington, sequestration and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan winding down, some are skeptical that there will be big cuts in defense contracting.</p>
<p>&#8220;While I would not expect big growth in this sector, and even with smaller defense budgets, defense contracts will be protected from deep cuts,&#8221; said Michael O&#8217;Hanlon, a senior fellow at the <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/" target="_blank">Brookings Institution</a>.</p>
<p>Even if there are cuts, the companies will be able to sustain themselves because they have learned to &#8220;evolve&#8221; as the DOD&#8217;s needs change, Pastor said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s still my belief that the companies that are in Arizona will continue to play an active role in the defense of this country,&#8221; he said.</p>
