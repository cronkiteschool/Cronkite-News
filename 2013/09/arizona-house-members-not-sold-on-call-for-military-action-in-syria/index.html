</div></div><p><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">WASHINGTON &#8211; Four of Arizona&#8217;s nine House members said they will oppose a U.S. attack on Syria and at least four others said they are not sure how they will vote when Congress returns next week.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s not going to make a decision without hearing the evidence and participating in the debate,&#8221; said Mark Kimble, whose boss, Rep. Ron Barber, D-Tucson, was one of the four still <a href="http://barber.house.gov/press-release/us-rep-ron-barber’s-statement-today’s-developments-involving-syria" target="_blank">weighing a decision</a>.</p>
<p>Others said that they could still change their vote &#8211; if &#8220;hellacious&#8221; new evidence was presented by the Obama administration &#8211; but that they have pretty much made up their minds.</p>
<p>&#8220;The administration failed to present a convincing argument that the events in Syria pose a clear threat to America,&#8221; Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Mesa, <a href="http://salmon.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/chairman-salmon-rejects-use-of-us-military-force-in-syria" target="_blank">said in a statement</a> after a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing Wednesday at which administration officials pressed their case.</p>
<p>President Barack Obama asked Congress for authority to take &#8220;limited&#8221; military action against the Syrian government for the reported use of chemical weapons against civilians and rebels in that country on Aug. 21. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad crossed a &#8220;red line&#8221; with the attacks, which demand a response, Obama said.</p>
<p>The president says he can order a strike on his own but announced last weekend that he would <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/08/31/president-obamas-statement-syria" target="_blank">go to Congress</a> for approval &#8211; even though lawmakers are on recess until next week.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think a lot of people in Congress wanted the president to take it to Congress, but I think a lot didn&#8217;t want to have to vote on it,&#8221; said Kyle Kondik, managing editor of the political analysis website Larry Sabato&#8217;s <a href="http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/" target="_blank">Crystal Ball</a> at the University of Virginia Center for Politics. &#8220;It&#8217;s a political no-win for them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Both of Arizona&#8217;s senators voted in committee Wednesday to <a href="http://www.foreign.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/DAV13973.pdf" target="_blank">OK a military strike</a>, with Sen. Jeff Flake saying evidence that the Syrian government used chemical weapons against its own people was too strong to ignore.</p>
<p>But House members were not convinced this week.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not in favor of trying to bail out the president, who boxed himself into a corner,&#8221; said Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Prescott. &#8220;I think there&#8217;s more at stake than the president&#8217;s ego.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gosar said he could not trust the president or Secretary of State John Kerry, who he said have &#8220;led from behind&#8221; on Syria and are now &#8220;trying to play catch-up.&#8221; Despite Kerry&#8217;s repeated assurances that there would be no U.S. troops drawn in to the conflict, Gosar was also concerned about risking American lives &#8220;just to send a message to Assad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When you fire a missile, there&#8217;s going be some retaliation &#8211; you better have an orchestrated plan of where you&#8217;re going to go with this,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Salmon and Gosar were joined in their opposition by Reps. Raul Grijalva, D-Tucson, and David Schweikert, R-Fountain Hills.</p>
<p>&#8220;David isn&#8217;t convinced there is a U.S. interest yet,&#8221; said Schweikert spokeswoman Rachel Semmel. &#8220;If we become engaged with little direction from the president, what is our exit strategy?&#8221;</p>
<p>Salmon said Kerry&#8217;s testimony Wednesday led him to believe the U.S. &#8220;would be left to strike unilaterally and without a broad coalition of other nations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aides said Grijalva was traveling this week, but on social media sites he previously noted his opposition to U.S. military action in Syria.</p>
<p>&#8220;Attacking Syria is the wrong course of action,&#8221; Grijalva&#8217;s official Twitter account said Aug. 30. &#8220;We need prevention right now, not punishment.&#8221;</p>
<p>The opposition brings together Grijalva, one of the delegation&#8217;s most liberal members, with some of its most conservative. But the split has otherwise followed party lines &#8211; so far.</p>
<p>Along with Barber, Democratic Reps. Ed Pastor of Phoenix, <a href="http://kirkpatrick.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/statement-on-potential-us-military-action-against-syria" target="_blank">Ann Kirkpatrick</a> of Flagstaff and <a href="http://sinema.house.gov/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=5229219b-2822-45bf-8d06-a29210c1b682" target="_blank">Kyrsten Sinema</a> of Phoenix also said they would not decide on Syria until they have received briefings on the issue and debated the resolution in Congress.</p>
<p>&#8220;As they return, they&#8217;re going to get more briefings, they&#8217;re going to get more information and there will actually be a House resolution to look at and debate,&#8221; said Jennifer Johnson, Kirkpatrick&#8217;s communications director.</p>
<p>Gosar said that while he had not received a full intelligence briefing, &#8220;it&#8217;d have to be some hellacious change of information before I could reconsider saying no.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rep. Trent Franks, R-Glendale, did not respond to repeated requests for comment.</p>
<p>Kondik said there seem to be a &#8220;heck of a lot more&#8221; opponents to the Syria strike and few supporters in Congress.</p>
<p>&#8220;Opponents seem to be a lot louder and prouder now,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If you just look at the numbers, passage looks pretty challenging.&#8221;</p>
