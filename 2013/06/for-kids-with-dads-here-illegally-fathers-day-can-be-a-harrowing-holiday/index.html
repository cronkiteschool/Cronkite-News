      <p>WASHINGTON &#8211; Jennifer Briones&#8217; family usually gathers for a barbecue in the park for Father&#8217;s Day, but the 16-year-old Phoenix resident said she will likely find something else to do if the family gets together this weekend.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s because Jennifer doesn&#8217;t want to imagine her dad &#8211; an illegal immigrant who was arrested last year for driving without a license &#8211; spending the holiday in prison.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hard to know he&#8217;s not here with me and I can&#8217;t show him support,&#8221; said Jennifer, a rising senior at Xavier College Preparatory.</p>
<p>Jennifer&#8217;s dad is just one of millions of parents who face the threat of deportation because they are in this country illegally with their kids. The <a href="http://www.pewhispanic.org/2009/04/14/iii-demographic-and-family-characteristics/" target="_blank">Pew Research Hispanic Center</a> estimated that in 2008 as many as 2.4 million fathers and 2.6 million mothers were living illegally in the U.S. with their children.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.vanderbilt.edu/sociology/VDOS_People_KatharineDonato.shtml" target="_blank">Katharine Donato</a>, a Vanderbilt University sociology professor who studies immigration and immigrant families, said the effects of deportation and separation can be harrowing for children like Jennifer.</p>
<p>&#8220;For a 16-year-old in the middle of high school, I can only imagine how distressing this is,&#8221; Donato said. &#8220;Everything about her world has been shattered.&#8221;</p>
<p>Children of illegal immigrants are often U.S. citizens and they live normal lives &#8211; going to school, playing soccer on weekends or taking piano lessons weekly &#8211; until a parent is arrested or deported. After that, Donato said, their lives change dramatically.</p>
<p>Besides the financial impact from the loss of a parent&#8217;s income, separation from a parent can also affect a child&#8217;s academic performance, Donato said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes kids drop out of school because of stresses,&#8221; Donato said, adding that adolescence is hard enough for kids without the threat of having a parent deported. &#8220;There&#8217;s so much stress on many levels.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jennifer, a U.S. citizen, was one of those typical American kids Donato mentioned: She said she did not even realize her dad risked deportation until one day as a young child, when her mother warned her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I always hoped we would be lucky and something like that wouldn&#8217;t happen,&#8221; Jennifer said. &#8220;When it happened it was just devastating.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her dad, Antonio Molina, was pulled over last June and charged with driving without a license, then handed over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement when authorities learned that he was undocumented.</p>
<p>After seven months in ICE detention, he was released on probation &#8211; but not before missing a court date on a pending drunken driving charge because he was in jail. That missed court date landed him back in detention when he showed up in March for an immigration check-in.</p>
<p>Jennifer and her younger sister had gone with their dad to that check-in and waited for him to come out. And waited.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was really afraid and I didn&#8217;t know where he was,&#8221; Jennifer remembered.</p>
<p>They learned he had been re-arrested but it took another two months before they learned why and where he was being held. She last saw him a month ago, before he was moved from Phoenix to Florence.</p>
<p>Jennifer, a high school senior who dreams of pursuing film production and combining it with her love of politics and psychology, tells the story of her dad&#8217;s arrest with little emotion. But she says it was a painful day, and it has been painful since.</p>
<p>Jennifer began visiting her dad in jail, but worried about troubling him and tried to &#8220;put up this facade&#8221; during visits.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want him to be more upset,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Jennifer said she admires her father, who fled El Salvador 20 years ago to escape a war. Even though he has witnessed so much, &#8220;he&#8217;s still able to keep a sense of humor,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;In many ways, me and my dad are very similar,&#8221; Jennifer said. &#8220;We&#8217;re both patient and listeners and like talking to people.&#8221;</p>
<p>But they&#8217;re different, too: Where her father has a more sensitive side, Jennifer said she does not like to show her emotions.</p>
<p>She tries to avoid thinking about her dad&#8217;s situation by working at her job and by preparing for senior year of high school. She tries not to think about spending her first Father&#8217;s Day without him around.</p>
<p>She instead thinks about him getting out of jail and coming to see her graduate next year. She already knows what she will say when they&#8217;re reunited.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll just tell him that I&#8217;m happy that he&#8217;s with me and that I love him,&#8221; Jennifer said.</p>
