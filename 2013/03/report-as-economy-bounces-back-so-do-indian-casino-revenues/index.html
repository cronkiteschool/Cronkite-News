      <div class="related_stories"><div class="glance_box_headline_in_page">Bouncing back</div><div class="glance_box_in_page"><p>As tribal gaming revenue started to decline in 2009, tribal gaming contributions to the state started to drop as well. Here's a look at the amount contributed to Arizona by tribes before and after.</p>
<p>Fiscal 2004: $40.6 million</p>
<p>Fiscal 2005: $73.0 million</p>
<p>Fiscal 2006: $91.7 million</p>
<p>Fiscal 2007: $103.6 million</p>
<p>Fiscal 2008: $111.2 million</p>
<p>Fiscal 2009: $97.5 million</p>
<p>Fiscal 2010: $89.0 million</p>
<p>Fiscal 2011: $90.5 million</p>
<p>Fiscal 2012: $97.3 million</p>
</div></div><p>WASHINGTON &#8211; Revenue from tribal gaming in Arizona grew at more than twice the national rate in 2011, rising for a second year as the economy inched out of recession, a new report says.</p>
<p>Casino City&#8217;s 2013 Indian Gaming Industry Report said the state&#8217;s 22 casinos, run by 15 tribes, posted $1.76 billion in revenues in 2011, the most recent year available. That was up 7.3 percent from $1.64 billion a year earlier.</p>
<p>Arizona moved from 20th place among states for tribal casino revenues to sixth place during that time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Slowly but surely the economy is coming back around,&#8221; said Valerie Spicer, executive director for the Arizona Indian <a href="http://www.azindiangaming.org/index.htm" target="_blank">Gaming Association</a>. &#8220;When the gaming numbers come back up, the contributions to the <a href="http://www.benefitingarizona.org/arizona-benefits-fund" target="_blank">Arizona Benefits Fund</a> go up, and that affects everybody in the state.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.casinocitypress.com/" target="_blank">The report</a> also showed an increase in non-gaming revenues, which rose 7.5 percent in 2011, as casinos have tried to diversify in the face of regulation, maturing gaming markets, increased competition and Internet gaming.</p>
<p>Arizona tribes have turned their attention to expanding operations and improving the non-gaming elements in their casinos, the report said. Spicer pointed to a new Gila River Indian Community outlet mall and the report noted the addition of hotel and conference facilities to casinos.</p>
<p>Economist Alan Meister, the author of the report, called the industry&#8217;s performance especially encouraging because the U.S. economy is still coming out of the recession.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s taken some time,&#8221; he said of the casinos&#8217; comeback, but he predicted further growth as the economy improves, casinos are upgraded, competition remains scarce, the industry evolves and restrictions are eased.</p>
<p>Spicer said it is important to remember that the tribal gaming market is unique because of &#8220;deficits that existed for hundreds of years before.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re starting from a deficit and building up,&#8221; she said, and there is still room for growth. But &#8220;we have to be mindful that there may be a point where that levels off.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meister said there are clouds  on the horizon. As one example, he cited the gaming compacts with states that can limit the amount of money a tribe can make.</p>
<p>&#8220;The tribes in some places have hit some barriers where they couldn&#8217;t grow any more in terms of meeting demands,&#8221; Meister said, meaning that crowded casinos with long lines for the slot machines were stuck.</p>
<p>He said several large tribes were able to gain some wiggle room by amending their compacts before the recession.</p>
<p>Spicer said Arizona&#8217;s 2002 compact gave tribes an economic opportunity that they had been deprived of for a long time, while giving the state a new source of revenue.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s given a framework and structure to spread out the benefits of gaming throughout the state,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Meister said tribal gaming has become a key piece of the economy for both Native Americans and Americans.</p>
<p>&#8220;In total, Indian gaming is contributing to the U.S. economy. When you look at taxes, a lot of tribes make payments directly to federal governments,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The Arizona Department of Gaming recently reported that tribal casinos&#8217; <a href="http://www.gm.state.az.us/tcontributions_pdf/TC_Cumulative.pdf" target="_blank">contributions to state coffers</a> had increased for the last 10 quarters.</p>
<p>Jelena Momich, a project specialist with the department, said that is good news for Arizona&#8217;s education, wildlife conservation fund and trauma and emergency services. The money is also used to support state tourism efforts.</p>
<p>&#8220;With the improving economy and consumer confidence on the rise, I&#8217;m hopeful we can maintain this trend and the state&#8217;s important programs will continue to benefit from these funds,&#8221; Momich said.</p>
<p>But there are drawbacks that come with the benefits, said Keith Whyte, executive director of the National Council on Problem Gambling.</p>
<p>Whyte said that as gambling revenue rises, the programs that most need funding are those to help gambling addicts.</p>
<p>&#8220;In general, there is a link between increased gambling and increased gambling problems,&#8221; Whyte said. &#8220;You cannot maximize the economic benefits of gaming without minimizing the social cost.&#8221;</p>
<p>A portion of Arizona casino revenues are used for the state&#8217;s Office of Problem Gambling. Whyte said Arizona is &#8220;one of the rare states&#8221; where the effort is left solely to a state office, without help from tribes or other organizations.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know if that is healthy in the long-term. I think there is probably a lack of a range of services available,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>As casinos continue to grow, it is important that they operate responsibly and legally, Whyte said. &#8220;Gambling revenue is not painless,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Spicer said all of Arizona&#8217;s tribal casinos are very careful.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everybody wants gaming to be a healthy, entertainment-driven scenario,&#8221; she said. &#8220;As revenue goes up, contribution goes up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spicer said casino revenues also remain a vital source of income for tribes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tribal governments are able to provide services in their communities far better than they would have been able to when the numbers were down,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Meister agreed that continued growth would be good for tribes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the whole purpose of Indian gaming is to enable tribes to support themselves and their tribal members,&#8221; he said.</p>
