      <p>WASHINGTON &#8211; Nate Ruess is a Glendale kid whose musical aspirations when he was in Deer Valley High School only extended as far as being in &#8220;a punk band and out on tour.&#8221;</p>
<p>He&#8217;s done that. And then some.</p>
<p>Ruess, now 30, will perform with his band, Fun., at Sunday&#8217;s <a href="http://www.grammy.com/" target="_blank">Grammy Awards</a>, where they have been nominated for six Grammys, including best new artist, song and album.</p>
<p>The awards show comes less than three weeks after Fun. played at an inaugural ball in Washington, an event that Reuss considered &#8220;the honor of my life&#8221; and where he got to shake President Barack Obama&#8217;s hand.</p>
<p>In between Deer Valley High School and the Grammys, Ruess traveled a road that included several bands, clubs from the East Valley to New York and a single, &#8220;We Are Young,&#8221; that topped the charts for six weeks. Combined single sales from <a href="http://www.ournameisfun.com/" target="_blank">Fun.</a>&#8216;s album &#8220;Some Nights&#8221; surpassed 10 million.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been like a wild ride,&#8221; Ruess said recently. &#8220;And it&#8217;s just getting started.&#8221;</p>
<p>It began almost 15 years ago in high school where Ruess joined friends to form a punk band, Nevergonnascore. His first label deal was signed with 16-year-old classmate Mike Jarmuz.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were somewhat kind of outcasts,&#8221; said Jarmuz. &#8220;Everyone kind of thought we were crazy.&#8221;</p>
<p>For Ruess, who describes himself as &#8220;very awkward&#8221; at the time, there were no lofty aspirations.</p>
<p>&#8220;I just wanted to be in a punk band and out on tour,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I wanted to come out and play a show someplace.&#8221;</p>
<p>After high school, he helped form This Past Year, a short-lived band that never released a record. But his next band, The Format, started getting play on Valley radio stations and started getting Ruess noticed.</p>
<p>&#8220;They were a big deal before they even played a single show,&#8221; said Bob Hoag, who produced &#8220;EP,&#8221; The Format&#8217;s first album. &#8220;The closest thing to Beatlemania I&#8217;ve ever seen locally. It was awesome.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ruess had approached Hoag with longtime friend and band partner Sam Means, a guitarist, about the possibility of working together, and in January 2002 the three produced &#8220;The First Single.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When we made the first mix of it and I went to write on the CD what the name of the song was, I&#8217;m like, &#8216;What&#8217;s the name of the song?&#8217;&#8221; Hoag said. &#8220;And they&#8217;re like, as a joke, &#8216;We&#8217;re calling this &#8216;The First Single.&#8221;&#8221;</p>
<p>It turned out to be far from a joke.</p>
<p>Jarmuz, who was Means&#8217; roommate at the time, took the song to Nancy Stevens, then the program director for alternative radio station KEDJ.</p>
<p>&#8220;We came out with this new project and hadn&#8217;t played any new shows before we recorded,&#8221; Ruess said. &#8220;We recorded the &#8216;EP&#8217; with Bob Hoag, and we just came out on fire. Radio stations were playing us.&#8221;</p>
<p>The five-song &#8216;EP&#8217; was released that summer. Jarmuz and Stevens formed a joint management company to take over the reins of The Format. By fall, Elektra Records had flown the band to Los Angeles to perform for company executives.</p>
<p>Steve Tramposch, a former director of talent scouting for Elektra Records, said the band&#8217;s sound &#8220;was just completely fresh to my ears.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There were pop elements in it. There were alternative elements in it,&#8221; said Tramposch, who found the band and introduced them to the national scene.</p>
<p>Ruess and Means would release their first full-length album the following year. The Format was on the rise.</p>
<p>That was obvious to Val Olsen the first time she saw the band perform. Olsen had lived a few doors down from the Ruess&#8217; North Phoenix home and would babysit the &#8220;well-mannered&#8221; and &#8220;animated&#8221; kid she still calls Nathan, or Nater-Skater, his boyhood nickname in her home.</p>
<p>&#8220;And here&#8217;s Nathan on stage,&#8221; Olsen recalls. &#8220;And the kids in the audience &#8211; they were just so into it.</p>
<p>&#8220;(His mother) and I left where it was a little more quiet, and I said, &#8216;Who is that up there on the stage?&#8217;&#8221; Olsen recalls.</p>
<p>After The Format broke up in 2008, Ruess and others formed Fun. and moved to New York. The new band&#8217;s first album came out in 2009, but Fun. started getting significant attention with its second album, &#8220;Some Nights,&#8221; last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;I always knew that they had built an underground following and that once he put together Fun. that following would follow him,&#8221; Tramposch said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just gratifying that they have good music and that his hard work and keeping at it really paid off for him in the long run.&#8221;</p>
