      <div class="related_stories"><div class="glance_box_headline_in_page">The Edson program:</div><div class="glance_box_in_page"><p>• Began in 2005</p>
<p>• Launched with a $5.4 million donation from Orin Edson, founder of Bayliner Marine Corp., a manufacturer of pleasure and luxury boats.</p>
<p>• Benefits up to 20 ventures a year, providing varying amounts of funding up to $20,000 at a maximum of $200,000 a year.</p>
<p>• Recipients have 24/7 access to a cubicle and conference rooms in ASU SkySong and are matched with mentors.</p>
</div></div><p>SCOTTSDALE – Mark Sholin&#8217;s desk is littered with handwritten notes about deadlines, leads and operational details that must be addressed before his startup company launches in three months.</p>
<p>He and three others in his management team are out to show that ARBSource can manage the wastewater of food and beverage production plants in a more energy- and cost-efficient way. So far, they have one client: a brewery.</p>
<p>&#8220;The market opportunity is huge, and I want to take advantage of it,&#8221; Sholin said.</p>
<p>But there are marked differences between ARBSource and other startups, beginning with its location: SkySong, Arizona State University&#8217;s innovation center. For a year that ends in June, Sholin and his team have received free workspace along with a $10,000 grant and mentorship arranged by the university.</p>
<p>In the cubicle next to his, someone is working to get a disc jockey service off the ground. Down the hall is a fledgling snowsports apparel company.</p>
<p>Each of these startups benefited from the Edson Student Entrepreneur Initiative, which since 2005 has selected up to 20 student business plans per year to foster at SkySong.</p>
<p>&#8220;Edson was where things got started,&#8221; said Sholin, whose business plan won in 2011. &#8220;The learning curve for me and ARBSource was accelerated by ASU&#8217;s resources.&#8221;</p>
<p>The program is made possible by a $5.4 million grant from Orin Edson, founder of Bayliner Marine Corp., a manufacturer of pleasure and luxury boats. Students receive varying amounts of money depending on their needs out of $200,000 available each year.</p>
<p>Will Curran, an ASU senior who received the Edson grant in 2010 and 2011, is using the program to expand Arizona Pro DJs, a teen entertainment company he founded in 2007.</p>
<p>&#8220;You always hear the 1 percent success stories, the Mark Zuckerbergs and Bill Gateses, but you never hear about the people who stay in school and start a business,&#8221; Curran said. &#8220;Programs like Edson encourage people to start working on their businesses now. While it&#8217;s hard because you have to juggle more stuff, it&#8217;s actually easier because you have so many resources available.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gordon McConnell, executive director for venture acceleration at SkySong, said a good idea often isn&#8217;t enough to make a business work.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everyone thinks they have the next big thing,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The great thing about Edson is that it provides the resources and mentorship necessary for success.&#8221;</p>
<p>McConnell oversees the Edson program as well as Venture Catalyst, a program helping faculty, students and companies aligned with ASU to launch startups or build on existing ventures.</p>
<p>He said these programs stem from a larger initiative fostering innovation and entrepreneurship at ASU.</p>
<p>&#8220;Entrepreneurship is nicely spread throughout ASU,&#8221; McConnell said. &#8220;Teaching it gives students a grasp of the flavor and art of it, and programs like Edson help students take what they learned and put it into action.&#8221;</p>
<p>Almost a year after transitioning away from Edson, Jeff Kunowski said his business, Illumin8 Outdoor Media LLC, which sells portable lighted signs, benefited from the time he spent at SkySong.</p>
<p>&#8220;I learned a lot from the different internships I&#8217;ve had, but Edson was the first real validation for my idea,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The office space and mentoring were really helpful in launching me from an idea to a successful business.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to get distracted thinking about the future of a venture, said Kunowski, a 2010 Edson winner. He said he encourages other student entrepreneurs to stay in the present.</p>
<p>&#8220;Remain fully engaged in your project,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Talk to as many mentors as possible and do your research. Ideas are good, but they&#8217;re nothing without execution.&#8221;</p>
<p>Brent Sebold, program manager for the Edson Student Entrepreneur Initiative within the Venture Catalyst, said the program has established a network that helps students.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are here to help startups be successful, especially ones that have high potential for job creation,&#8221; Sebold said. &#8220;In a down economy, people are looking at going into business on their own. If you don&#8217;t have a job, you find problems, create solutions and commercialize the solutions. That&#8217;s what we&#8217;re doing here.&#8221;</p>
<p>After almost a year in the encouraging environment of SkySong, Sholin is facing a summer that will test everything he&#8217;s learned. If ARBSource fails, however, he said that it wouldn&#8217;t be a complete loss.</p>
<p>&#8220;If that happened I would be devastated of course, but I would be really happy to take the skills I have learned and the connections I have made and share those with others who are trying to innovate in the water industry,&#8221; he said.</p>
