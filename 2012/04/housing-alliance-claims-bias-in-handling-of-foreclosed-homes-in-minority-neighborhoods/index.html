      <div class="related_stories"><div class="glance_box_headline_in_page">Foreclosed and forgotten?</div><div class="glance_box_in_page"><p>A new national report claims that upkeep and marketing of bank-owned properties in minority neighborhoods is lacking compared to predominantly white neighborhoods. Among findings in Phoenix, the report said:</p>
<p>• <b>Foreclosed homes with more than five maintenance problems</b><br />
Hispanic neighborhoods: 73 percent<br />
White neighborhoods: 25 percent</p>
<p>• <b>Foreclosed homes with more than 10 maintenance problems</b><br />
Hispanic neighborhoods: 19 percent<br />
White neighborhoods: 0 percent</p>
<p>• <b>Foreclosed homes missing a "For Sale" sign</b><br />
Hispanic neighborhoods: 73 percent<br />
White neighborhoods: 31 percent</p>
<p><i>Source: "The Banks are Back - Our Neighborhoods are Not: Discrimination in the Maintenance and Marketing of REO Properties," National Fair Housing Alliance</i></p>
</div></div><p>WASHINGTON – Banks are neglecting foreclosed homes in minority neighborhoods compared to those in white communities, according to a housing advocacy group that said it will file Fair Housing Act complaints over the supposed practice.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.nationalfairhousing.org/" target="_blank">National Fair Housing Alliance</a> looked at 1,036 foreclosed homes over the last year in nine markets, including Phoenix, and said there were &#8220;troubling disparities in maintenance and marketing practices&#8221; of foreclosed properties in predominantly black and Hispanic neighborhoods.</p>
<p>It <a href="http://www.nationalfairhousing.org/Portals/33/the_banks_are_back_web.pdf" target="_blank">said</a> 73 percent of foreclosed homes surveyed in Hispanic neighborhoods in Phoenix had more than five maintenance problems, compared to 25 percent of foreclosed homes in white neighborhoods.</p>
<p>&#8220;Phoenix was targeted (for the investigation) because of their very, very high foreclosure rates,&#8221; said Shanna Smith, president and CEO of housing alliance. &#8220;The blight that these neighborhoods have suffered from is all the responsibility of the banks.&#8221;</p>
<p>But officials at the <a href="http://www.aba.com/default.htm" target="_blank">American Bankers Association</a> said banks &#8220;strive to sell foreclosures as quickly as possible,&#8221; no matter what neighborhood the house is in.</p>
<p>&#8220;Banks operate and are examined under fair-lending and fair-housing laws to ensure equal treatment across all communities,&#8221; said Bob Davis, executive vice president for mortgage policy, in an email. &#8220;Banks take care of these houses to preserve their collateral regardless of where the property is located.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Smith said the report found foreclosed homes in minority communities were more likely to have maintenance problems, be littered with trash, have broken or boarded windows and lack a &#8220;For Sale&#8221; sign. She said the alliance plans to file racial discrimination complaints with the Department of Housing and Urban Development against several major lenders as a result.</p>
<p>Smith hoped the move would lead lenders to &#8220;reach out &#8230; to preserve the asset and help the neighborhood.&#8221; But, she warned, &#8220;If people want to get into lengthy litigation, we&#8217;ll certainly have the resources to do that.&#8221;</p>
<p>The alliance investigation was partially funded by <a href="http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/press/press_releases_media_advisories/2011/HUDNo.11-244" target="_blank">grants</a> from HUD, which gave fair housing organizations $28 million in October to investigate housing discrimination, according to the department website.</p>
<p>The foreclosed homes were graded on 39 different maintenance and marketing factors, such as curb appeal, structure, damage and presence of professional &#8220;For Sale&#8221; signs, what Smith called &#8220;routine maintenance&#8221; of a property.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve never expected a lender or a bank to put more money into the house than is feasible for the surrounding neighborhood,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The study looked at 72 foreclosed homes in the Phoenix area, but only those in Hispanic neighborhoods got grades of D or F for maintenance and marketing. Fourteen of the 16 foreclosed homes in predominantly white neighborhoods got an A or a B.</p>
<p>Maryvale was one Hispanic community the alliance looked at in November. Smith said she was contacted by the National <a href="http://nahrep.org/" target="_blank">Association</a> of Hispanic Real Estate Professionals, which she said was &#8220;distressed with the low quality of maintenance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Foreclosed Maryvale homes are not kept up but &#8220;just left to flip into the hands of the next investor,&#8221; said Gail Buck, a founder of the Arizona chapter of the Hispanic real estate group.</p>
<p>&#8220;This area of town has suffered a very high level of foreclosure,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Without owner-occupants, we cannot stabilize the communities.&#8221;</p>
<p>Buck said she is actively involved in Maryvale, an area of 30,000 single-family homes that is 92 percent Hispanic. But she disagrees that the problem is solely race-based.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s race-based &#8211; I think it&#8217;s lower-income,&#8221; Buck said. But &#8220;low income also coincides largely with Hispanic demographics.&#8221;</p>
<p>And maintaining foreclosed homes in low-income neighborhoods is the responsibility of real estate agents as well as banks, she added.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the end of the day, it&#8217;s the real estate professional&#8217;s job to push back . . . to let them know this home is not being cared for,&#8221; Buck said. &#8220;The banks that we represent aren&#8217;t triggering the job (of upkeep). We need to push back and make sure that they are.&#8221;</p>
