      <div class="related_stories"><div class="glance_box_headline_in_page">What the court said</div><div class="glance_box_in_page"><p>In its 5-4 decision upholding the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the U.S. Supreme Court made several key rulings:</p>
<p>• It rejected the administration's claim that the individual mandate is covered under the commerce clause, a constitutional power of the government to regulate trade between states.</p>
<p>• It found in the alternative that the mandate - a penalty on anyone who refuses to buy insurance - is a tax and it is therefore constitutional for Congress to levy it.</p>
<p>• It said the federal government cannot "compel" states to take part in a Medicaid expansion by taking away all Medicaid funding to a state that refuses. But states can still participate and receive a promised funding increase from the federal government.</p>

</div></div><p>WASHINGTON &#8211; Arizona officials were sifting through the Supreme Court&#8217;s Thursday decision upholding the bulk of the national healthcare reform act and deciding what steps, if any, to take next.</p>
<p>Arizona, like many states, has been moving forward with plans to set up a <a href="http://www.azgovernor.gov/hix/" target="_blank">health insurance exchange</a>, a sort of marketplace for insurance consumers that is required under the act.</p>
<p>Even though Gov. Jan Brewer criticized the &#8220;disheartening&#8221; <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/11-393c3a2.pdf" target="_blank">ruling Thursday</a>, state officials were not ready to back away from the exchange. Or to embrace it.</p>
<p>&#8220;The governor will make a final decision &#8230; after we&#8217;ve had a chance to review the decision and evaluate where we are on the exchange work,&#8221; said Don Hughes, director of the Arizona Health Insurance Exchange.</p>
<p>If states are not making progress on their exchanges by 2013, the federal government could step in and run the exchange itself, a prospect that many find unpalatable.</p>
<p>&#8220;A state-based health insurance exchange is much preferable to having the federal government design one for Arizona,&#8221; said Garrick Taylor, spokesman for the <a href="http://www.azchamber.com/" target="_blank">Arizona Chamber</a> of Commerce, which opposes the act.</p>
<p>&#8220;It gives Arizona flexibility and ability to craft an exchange that fits Arizona needs,&#8221; Taylor said of the prospect of a state-run exchange.</p>
<p>Arizona insurance companies also said they will help state officials create an exchange. <a href="http://www.azblue.com/" target="_blank">Blue Cross</a> Blue Shield of Arizona released a statement saying it &#8220;will work with state lawmakers to enact a state-based insurance exchange.&#8221;</p>
<p>The deadline for the exchange is one of several in the act, which was &#8220;largely unscathed&#8221; by the court, in the words of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.</p>
<p>Besides the exchanges, the act calls on states to expand their <a href="http://www.medicaid.gov/" target="_blank">Medicaid</a> eligibility and it imposes a national &#8220;individual mandate,&#8221; which requires the people have health insurance by 2014 or pay a penalty.</p>
<p>It is &#8220;too early to tell&#8221; if Arizona will participate in Medicaid expansion, said Taryn Morrissey, a public policy professor at American University.</p>
<p>&#8220;Republicans have vowed to introduce legislation to repeal the entire act,&#8221; Morrissey said. &#8220;They haven&#8217;t really provided an alternative but I&#8217;m sure in this election year there will be continued talk about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The court Thursday rejected a part of the law that would have let the federal government strip Medicaid funding from states that did not expand the program &#8211; a part of the act that Chief Justice John Roberts called &#8220;a gun to the head&#8221; for states. In Arizona, for example, more than half of the staet&#8217;s federal funding went to Medicaid in 2009, according to U.S. Census data.</p>
<p>Instead, Medicaid expansion can continue as a state option with the enticement of what the court called unusually generous federal funding. Many experts speculate the lure of federal funds will get most states to participate.</p>
<p>&#8220;There may political reasons why they don&#8217;t,&#8221; Morrissey said. &#8220;But the Medicaid expansion comes along with a lot of federal funds. It would be economically rational &#8230; to participate in the expansion.&#8221;</p>
<p>Morrisey said other issues may entice states to expand Medicaid, since not participating in the expansion could lead to a lack of coverage for some people. Those who neither fall below the poverty line nor meet the requirement to receive subsidies toward health insurance could fall into an assistance &#8220;gap.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There could be a gap between people,&#8221; Morrissey said. &#8220;Falling through the cracks so to speak.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rep. <a href="http://grijalva.house.gov/" target="_blank">Raul Grijalva</a>, D-Tucson, who rallied in support of the act in front of the Supreme Court Thursday, said it would be in Arizona&#8217;s interest to expand Medicaid coverage under the law.</p>
<p>&#8220;By opting in, states will receive additional support, but more importantly, you&#8217;re going to expand the base of coverage,&#8221; Grijalva said. &#8220;And that&#8217;s the whole point of this Affordable Care Act.&#8221;</p>
<p>But while some state officials said they wanted to study the opinion, many more were angry at the court&#8217;s decision.</p>
<p><a href="http://azgovernor.gov/" target="_blank">Brewer said</a> in a prepared statement Thursday that the act was &#8220;an overreaching and unaffordable assault on states&#8217; rights and individual liberty.&#8221;</p>
<p>The <a href="http://goldwaterinstitute.org/" target="_blank">Goldwater Institute</a> said it will move ahead with its lawsuit against a price-setting panel, set up by the health care law. That suit had been on hold pending the court&#8217;s decision.</p>
<p>Many Arizona Republicans, like Rep. <a href="http://flake.house.gov/" target="_blank">Jeff Flake</a>, R-Mesa, called for a congressional repeal of the act. Health care reform &#8220;will not only decrease the quality of healthcare in this country, but it will place an enormous burden on the economy,&#8221; Flake said in a statement.</p>
<p>Rep. <a href="http://schweikert.house.gov/" target="_blank">David Schweikert</a>, R-Scottsdale, went further, calling the act the &#8220;single most economically devastating government mandate our country has ever seen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If the Supreme Court will not repeal this job-killing, tax-hiking mandate, then I will fight until every ounce of ObamaCare is repealed and replaced,&#8221; he said in a statement Thursday.</p>
