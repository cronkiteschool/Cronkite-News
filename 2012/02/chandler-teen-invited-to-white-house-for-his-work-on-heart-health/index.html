      <p>WASHINGTON &#8211; Phoenix&#8217;s biggest champion against heart disease descended on the White House Friday to meet with top officials from the Obama administration at an event celebrating American Heart Month.</p>
<p>And his mom and dad came, too.</p>
<p>Emery Miller, a Chandler 13-year-old who has undergone four open-heart surgeries for congenital heart defects, has helped raise nearly $200,000 for the American Heart Association in Phoenix, which nominated him for the White House honor.</p>
<p>Coming to Washington meant missing the Phoenix Heart Walk, the first time he&#8217;s been absent since being born, but Emery said this opportunity was worth it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Coming up here is going to get us more money even though I&#8217;d love to be back in Arizona,&#8221; he said Friday. The White House event, which featured 150 people from around the country, was intended to raise awareness about cardiovascular disease, particularly among women and minorities.</p>
<p>It was great &#8220;just hanging out with people that you&#8217;re like,&#8221; Emery said. &#8220;Some of them have the same stories as you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Emery, a seventh-grader from Horizon Community Learning Center in Ahwatukee, has always had a personal stake in fighting heart disease and has been speaking to raise awareness since he was 5. He became even more involved two years ago, when a school counselor came to his class and talked about &#8220;paying it forward,&#8221; or doing a good deed for someone who returns the favor to somebody else.</p>
<p>It was around Christmas, and Emery decided that rather than get presents himself that year he wanted to &#8220;give a bear to every kid at the (Phoenix Children&#8217;s) hospital.&#8221; He set a goal of collecting a teddy bear for each of the 400 kids in the hospital, and wound up with 485.</p>
<p>His &#8220;bear drive&#8221; has since grown: He topped last year&#8217;s goal of 1,000 teddy bears by 400 as well as 600 other stuffed animals.</p>
<p>&#8220;I call it power of the people,&#8221; he said, explaining that all he does is ask others to help. &#8220;If you really want something done, people will do it &#8217;cause they want to help you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Emery said he likes helping others through tough times, and all he asks is that they pay it forward when they get better.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just seeing the support behind him is just an incredible feeling,&#8221; said Lori Miller, his mom. &#8220;He just has an army of people behind him.&#8221;</p>
<p>She said Emery uses his story to inspire others through his public speaking, in Phoenix, Seattle and Los Angeles.</p>
<p>&#8220;He creates hope for people in a hopeless situation,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>She is proud of her son&#8217;s accomplishments. But, after learning the day after he was born of all the challenges Emery would be up against in life, it&#8217;s often the small things that make her grateful.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the normal things I get choked up about,&#8221; said Miller, who cried the first time Emery rode a carousel. &#8220;All this is unreal . . .  this is the icing on the cake.&#8221;</p>
<p>The fight turns personal once again in April when Emery returns to the Phoenix Children&#8217;s Hospital for his fifth procedure. It will be the first since he was 6 and &#8220;the first one that I am actually &#8216;living&#8217; through,&#8221; said Emery, admitting he is worried, after first trying to hide behind his confidence.</p>
<p>He will be the first patient at the Phoenix Children&#8217;s Hospital to undergo a new procedure that installs a cow valve, which should lead to a faster recovery.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Emery and his parents have been enjoying several days in Washington.</p>
<p>At the White House with his mom Friday, he was tickled to ask a question of Jon Carson, the director of the Office of Public Engagement, that was &#8220;so scientific that I stumped him.&#8221; A huge hockey fan, he planned to wear his Coyotes jersey to a Washington Capitals game Friday.</p>
<p>Emery, who also plays baseball, said he would like to be a coach or general manager some day, or continue with his motivational speaking.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;d be cool to travel around the country and world speaking to kids,&#8221; he said. &#8220;As long as I don&#8217;t have to learn another language, I&#8217;ll be OK.&#8221;</p>
<p>And he hopes this trip to the White House is not his last.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was definitely a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, but I&#8217;m hoping it&#8217;s not a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I hope to come back.&#8221;</p>
