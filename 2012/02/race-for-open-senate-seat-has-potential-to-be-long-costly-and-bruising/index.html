<p><a href="../senate-hopefuls-brandish-outsider-status-even-if-they-worked-in-washington/index.html" target="_blank">Senate hopefuls brandish Washington 'outsider' label - even if they worked in Washington</a></p>
</div></div><p>WASHINGTON &#8211; For Tempe-based pollster Michael O&#8217;Neil, there are elections and then there are &#8220;real elections.&#8221;</p>
<p>He believes the race this year for the seat being vacated by Arizona Sen. Jon Kyl falls into the latter category.</p>
<p>Take the open seat, add a long primary season with four attractive candidates, in a red state that some believe could be in play in this presidential election year, and you have the elements for a &#8220;real election&#8221;: costly, long, bruising and with an uncertain outcome.</p>
<p>&#8220;Incumbents tend to get re-elected, they tend to have more money raised and it tends to be a foregone conclusion,&#8221; said O&#8217;Neil, president of public opinion research firm O&#8217;Neil Associates. &#8220;Without an incumbent, I don&#8217;t see it as a foregone conclusion.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kyl&#8217;s decision to step down means Arizona will not have an incumbent senator running for the first time in 18 years.</p>
<p>It has turned the safe Republican seat into a race both parties are watching closely, and one of only a few that pollsters and political analysts have given Democrats a chance of picking up in November.</p>
<p>Races for an open Senate seat usually feature highly competitive primaries, said Patrick Kenney, a political science professor at Arizona State University. They also tend to be more expensive and prompt higher voter turnouts, both in the primaries and general election.</p>
<p>Arizona&#8217;s Aug. 28 primary is also later than most states, making healthy fundraising even more important, Kenney said.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s some research that shows that . . . divisive or hard-fought primaries tend to exhaust campaigns,&#8221; said Kenney, the director of ASU&#8217;s School of Government, Politics and Global Studies. Arizona&#8217;s primary &#8220;is so late that it&#8217;s hard to restock.&#8221;</p>
<p>The major Senate candidates have been stocking up, according to the latest reports from the <a href="http://fec.gov/" target="_blank">Federal Election Commission</a>.</p>
<p>Front-runner Rep. Jeff Flake, R-Mesa, had just over $2.5 million on hand at the end of 2011, according to year-end FEC reports. His main GOP challenger, Wil Cardon, a millionaire businessman who is largely self-financing his campaign, had about $1.2 million on hand.</p>
<p>Cardon has vowed not to be outspent and more than 70 percent of his campaign money was his own. He raised about $100,000 in outside contributions in the fourth quarter of 2011, to Flake&#8217;s roughly $600,000.</p>
<p>On the Democratic side, former U.S. Surgeon General Richard Carmona reported having $543,521 on hand at the end of the year and former state party chairman Don Bivens had $504,105.</p>
<p>Carmona, a former independent who served under President George W. Bush, is the frontrunner because of his moderate politics and support from national Democrats, O&#8217;Neil said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Should Carmona get the nomination I think he&#8217;s a formidable candidate on the Democratic side,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil said. &#8220;Carmona&#8217;s independence makes him a stronger November candidate.&#8221;</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.dscc.org/featured_races?blog_entry_KEY=845" target="_blank">Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee</a>&#8216;s website all but endorses Carmona, saying, &#8220;Democrats have a winning candidate for this open seat in Richard Carmona.&#8221; Bivens is mentioned only as another Democratic candidate.</p>
<p>But Bivens said he cannot be counted out &#8211; nor should Carmona be counted in simply because he was a moderate independent recently turned Democrat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Arizona was considered a battleground state for Obama (in 2008) up and until the time John McCain became the (Republican) nominee,&#8221; Bivens said. &#8220;The notion that Arizona is not ready for Democratic values is nonsense.&#8221;</p>
<p>Carmona only declared his candidacy in November but he has picked up numerous endorsements, including one from Dennis DeConcini, the last Democrat to hold an Arizona Senate seat.</p>
<p>&#8220;All the campaigns are in a very early stage,&#8221; said Andy Barr, Carmona&#8217;s spokesman. &#8220;We&#8217;re getting off the ground here but we don&#8217;t believe we&#8217;re behind.&#8221;</p>
<p>Carmona&#8217;s chances may ultimately rest in the hands of President Barack Obama&#8217;s re-election campaign, said Kyle Kondik, an analyst at the University of Virginia&#8217;s Center for Politics. He said the White House more or less hand-picked Carmona because his appeal as a moderate could help bring out Arizona voters who will also vote for Obama.</p>
<p>Obama campaign staffers have made no secret that Arizona is a state they want to target in 2012, in large part because of a growing Latino demographic. It was the first state Obama visited following his State of the Union address last month to promote his economic agenda.</p>
<p>Arizona figures into the calculus of a broader Democratic strategy to build a Western coalition of blue states, alongside Nevada and Colorado, Kondik said. How competitive Arizona is for Obama will affect how much support the national party puts behind Carmona.</p>
<p>&#8220;National Democrats will make the determination here,&#8221; Kondik said. &#8220;As long as they think Carmona is competitive, they&#8217;ll make sure he has enough money.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Center for Politics has pegged Flake as the odds-on favorite. But Carmona&#8217;s entrance prompted it to <a href="http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/decembersenateupdate/" target="_blank">downgrade the race</a> from &#8220;likely Republican&#8221; to &#8220;leaning Republican,&#8221; making Kyl&#8217;s one of three Republican Senate seats Democrats have a chance of flipping in 2012, Kondik said.</p>
<p>He ranks Arizona third for a likely Democratic gain, after seats held by Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown and Nevada Sen. Dean Heller. But Flake is not worried.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got a good ground game and it&#8217;s getting stronger,&#8221; Flake said. &#8220;For Arizona, this is a high-stakes election.&#8221;</p>
<p>He laughed at the prospect of the Democratic nominee campaigning with Obama. &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure too many local candidates will be too excited to campaign with the president around the state,&#8221; Flake said.</p>
<p>Both he and Cardon are confident that Arizona will stay red, and neither is worried about the cost of their primary hurting Republican chances in the general election.</p>
<p>&#8220;People claiming Arizona is back in play are wrong,&#8221; Cardon said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a securely red state &#8230; the reason Jeff Flake is the favorite right now is name recognition, but if you look at both of us, we&#8217;re both ahead of the Democrats.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cardon cited a November poll by <a href="http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/pdf/2011/PPP_Release_AZ_1123424.pdf" target="_blank">Public Policy Polling</a> that showed him beating Carmona by 2 percentage points, 35-33, and Bivens by 8 points, 35-27. The Democratic polling firm gave Flake slightly better margins: a 40-36 lead over Carmona and a 42-32 advantage over Bivens.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.nrsc.org/" target="_blank">National Republican Senatorial Committee</a> is not taking sides in the primary, saying only that it is confident that a conservative Republican will win. But its attacks pointedly mention Carmona as the likely Democratic nominee.</p>
<p>And there&#8217;s another wild card to throw into the race, along with the open seat and the national attention: Kenney said independent expenditure committees &#8211; the so-called &#8220;super PACs&#8221; that can solicit unlimited donations &#8211; could come into play.</p>
<p>Others caution that money isn&#8217;t everything.</p>
<p>&#8220;Campaign finance is sometimes overstated,&#8221; Kondik said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not like the candidate who raises the most money always wins. If you&#8217;re the underdog, you need to raise enough money to get your message out.&#8221;</p>
<p>And while the primaries are shaping up as expensive, unpredictable and potentially bloody, all sides say they expect to have enough fight left for the general election.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t really see the concern,&#8221; of a long primary,said Barr, the Carmona spokesman. &#8220;I see it one way or another as a good warm-up act.&#8221;</p>
