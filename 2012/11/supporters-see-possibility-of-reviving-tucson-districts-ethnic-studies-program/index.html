      <div class="related_stories"><div class="glance_box_headline_in_page">About the Mexican American Studies program:</div><div class="glance_box_in_page"><p>• Began in the late 1990s in an effort to close the achievement gap of minority students in the Tucson Unified School District.<br />
• Barred under a 2010 state law barring schools from teaching classes that promote "the overthrow" of the government, encourage "ethnic solidarity" or "promote resentment" toward other ethnic groups.<br />
• The district's governing board appealed the ban but lost the case in late 2011.<br />
• Facing the loss of $14 million in state aid, the board voted to end the program as of January of this year.</p>
</div></div><p>TUCSON — Supporters of the Tucson Unified School District&#8217;s Mexican American  Studies curriculum banned by a 2010 state law see potential for reviving  the program or something similar in an update to a desegregation plan  set for review by a federal court.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The  plan stems from a 1978 settlement to a lawsuit alleging that the  district discriminated against African-American and Mexican-American  students. The draft update, filed Nov. 9 in U.S. District Court, is to a  plan the district, plaintiffs, U.S. Justice Department and a  court-appointed special master have offered to end court oversight and  close the case.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It  doesn&#8217;t cite Mexican American Studies classes directly but calls for  the implementation of &#8220;socially and culturally relevant curriculum&#8221;  focused on &#8220;the perspectives of African and Latino communities.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The way it&#8217;s written right now, it provides a great opportunity for  the reinstatement of this department,&#8221; said Lorenzo Lopez, a history  teacher at Cholla High School and a former Mexican American Studies  teacher.<br />
The Mexican American Studies program focused on the history and culture  of Latinos in America with an emphasis on Mexican-American literature.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The  program ended in January after the district unsuccessfully challenged  the law, spearheaded by former Superintendent of Public Instruction Tom  Horne, currently the state&#8217;s attorney general. Horne accused teachers of  politicizing classrooms and said the program segregated students.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The  law bars public schools from teaching classes that promote &#8220;the  overthrow&#8221; of the government, encourage &#8220;ethnic solidarity&#8221; or &#8220;promote  resentment&#8221; toward other ethnic groups.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The  end of the program sparked protests in the district, in which 61  percent of students are Latino. A separate lawsuit, filed by 13 Mexican  American Studies teachers and two students, is awaiting a decision in  state court.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The  desegregation plan centers on equalizing the racial makeup of the  district&#8217;s schools, enhancing the diversity of administrators and  improving educational opportunities for black and Hispanic students. The  draft update filed Nov. 9 is called a unitary status plan.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A  public comment period on the draft ends Wednesday, Nov. 28. The final  version is to be submitted to a federal judge on Dec. 10.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A  November news release from the Mexican American Legal Defense and  Education Fund (MALDEF) said an essential part of the plan is the  &#8220;restoration&#8221; of a Latino-focused curriculum.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Nancy  Ramirez, an attorney from MALDEF, said although the plan doesn&#8217;t refer  to the program specifically, the language is a strategy to improve  educational outcomes of black and Latino students and close achievement  gaps.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;The  language in the unitary status plan provides a framework and a mandate  for the district to provide culturally relevant curriculum with a Latino  focus,&#8221; Ramirez said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ramirez  said that if the proposed plan wins federal court approval, the state  law banning the Mexican American Studies program wouldn&#8217;t apply to it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;The state can object, just like anybody else who&#8217;s a member of the public,&#8221; Ramirez said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not a party to this action.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Neither  Horne nor current Superintendent of Public Instruction John Huppenthal  returned telephone messages seeking comment by Monday afternoon.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If  the plan wins court approval, it&#8217;s unclear how the district would  implement its requirements in light of the state restrictions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;It is a very contentious issue,&#8221; said Sam Brown, the district&#8217;s desegregation director.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Brown  said there&#8217;s no question if the proposed plan is approved by a federal  judge the &#8220;culturally relevant curriculum&#8221; would be implemented, but he  said the important question is whether the program will be the same as  before.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;Are you bringing back something that was here before or is it doing something different?&#8221; Brown said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He said that will be decided by the district&#8217;s governing board.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Stephen  Nuño, an associate professor at Northern Arizona University&#8217;s  Department of Politics and International Affairs, said the language  could create some kind of pathway to restore the Mexican American  Studies program.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;It pretty much substantively looks similar to what we&#8217;ve had in the past,&#8221; Nuño said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Nolan  Cabrera, an assistant professor at University of Arizona&#8217;s Center for  the Study of Higher Education, said the language in the plan leaves the  door open for the classes but doesn&#8217;t mandate them. Cabrera conducted a  study that found students who took Mexican American Studies courses  graduated high school and fared better on the AIMS test than those who  didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>&#8220;In  my interpretation, the wording allows for the possibility but is not an  explicit directive to restore that which has been eliminated,&#8221; Cabrera  said.</p>
