      <p>WASHINGTON – Ty Tsosie was taught by his Navajo elders that when he needed  spiritual reflection, he could go to the confluence of the Colorado and  Little Colorado rivers, a sacred place to the tribe.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you feel good about something, if you feel down about something, you go out there and pray,&#8221; Tsosie said.</p>
<p>But he fears that in the not-too-distant future he could be  sharing that sacred place on the eastern rim of the Grand Canyon with  camera-toting tourists.</p>
<p>A tribal chapter last month gave preliminary approval to a  proposed 420-acre development at the confluence that calls for a hotel,  RV park, motels, fast-food restaurants and a Navajo &#8220;cultural center.&#8221; A  &#8220;gondola tramway&#8221; would take visitors to the floor of the Grand Canyon,  where an elevated walkway near the river would lead tourists to a  restaurant.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have pavement. You&#8217;ll have people coming around,&#8221; Tsosie  said. &#8220;Who&#8217;s going to be praying in front of a tourist site?&#8221;</p>
<p>But supporters of the <a href="http://grandcanyonescalade.com/" target="_blank">Grand Canyon Escalade</a> project argue that  there is already considerable tourism at the site, from hikers, rafters  and others who may not revere the site as much as the Navajo do. They  say the project would give the tribe better management of the site while  providing a much-needed boon to a struggling Navajo economy, which is  particularly depressed on the western edge of the reservation where the  confluence is located.</p>
<p>Far from harming the tribe, the Grand Canyon Escalade project will  help preserve Navajo culture by creating jobs that would keep more  people on the reservation, said state Rep. Albert Hale, D-Window Rock,  the general counsel for the developers.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re pushing our children away from our culture, away from our  language away from our ceremonies. I don&#8217;t want this. I want our  children to be here,&#8221; Hale said.</p>
<p>The project is being developed by Confluence Partners LLC, a group  of three enrolled Navajo tribe members and five non-Navajo men. Their  plan calls for the Navajo Nation to spend about $60 million for  infrastructure, such as roads and power lines, while private investors  would pay for the first phase of development, expected to cost about  $125 million, said Michele Crank, a spokeswoman for the developers.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://bodaway.navajochapters.org/" target="_blank">Bodaway/Gap Chapter</a> of the tribe voted &#8211; barely &#8211; in October  to give the project the green light, after twice passing resolutions  earlier in the year in opposition to the development. The chapter would  cede the land for the project.</p>
<p>The 59-52 vote in support came after a heated meeting that had to  be shut down by police, in what has become an increasingly contentious  debate for tribal members. The subject is dividing friends and family on  and off the reservation and Crank, a Navajo herself, said she and  others in the development group have received threats.</p>
<p>&#8220;In all honesty, in all of the meetings I have been in, I have  never seen such disrespect as I have seen coming from the opponents,&#8221;  Crank said.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.navajo-nsn.gov/" target="_blank">Navajo Nation</a> police abruptly ended a Sept. 26 chapter meeting after attendees began to argue with each other.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody was hurt and nobody was arrested or anything like that. It  was just out of precaution,&#8221; said Erny Zah, a spokesman for the  president and vice president of the Navajo Nation.</p>
<p>A few days later, Bodaway-Gap members returned and voted to  support the project, at a meeting that was watched by tribal and state  police with an ambulance parked nearby, according to the Navajo Times  and Don Yellowman, a voting member of the chapter.</p>
<p>Yellowman, president of the grassroots Navajo organization <a href="http://www.forgottennavajopeople.com/" target="_blank"> Forgotten People</a>, said the chapter officials and the tribal government  were trying to send a message with the police presence that &#8220;no matter  what, even if a riot broke out, this vote will be carried out.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said there are still many unanswered questions about the development.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because of that, it&#8217;s causing division and animosity in the community,&#8221; Yellowman said.</p>
<p>Chapter officials did not reply to repeated phone calls or emails seeking comment.</p>
<p>But Hale, a former president of the Navajo Nation, said developers have shared the facts with the public.</p>
<p>&#8220;People have been very emotional and aggressive with their statements, but I just tell them what I see,&#8221; Hale said.</p>
<p>Confluence Partners estimates the project would produce about  2,000 permanent jobs after complete build-out, an enticing number on a  reservation that has an estimated unemployment rate between 40 and 50  percent.</p>
<p>And Bodaway-Gap is believed to be even worse off.</p>
<p>The area fell under a 1966 federal policy known as the Bennett  Freeze that halted all development on about 1.5 million acres of land  while a border dispute between the Hopi and Navajo was settled. That  stalled any prospect of progress on the Bennett Freeze lands: People  there went without basic infrastructure, such as electricity and running  water, for about 40 years.</p>
<p>Many residents of the affected communities left the area before  the Hopi and Navajo settled their issues in 2006. President Barack Obama  in 2009 ended the federal development ban there, but the stunted  communities are still trying to find ways to overcome the freeze&#8217;s  legacy.</p>
<p>While Hale maintains that the Grand Canyon Escalade project would  be an important step toward economic recovery, Tsosie and other  opponents see it as a step in the wrong direction.</p>
<p>Tsosie, who is one of many who had to leave the area in search of  opportunity, believes tribal leaders can come up with other ways to  boost the economy.</p>
<p>&#8220;We feel betrayed that our own tribe, our own people are agreeing with this project,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Tsosie &#8211; who like Yellowman is a member of <a href="http://savetheconfluence.com/" target="_blank">Save the Confluence</a> movement determined to stop the Grand Canyon Escalade &#8211; thinks  developers are purposely &#8220;side-stepping the people.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems like they&#8217;re just trying to jam this down our throat,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>For the moment, the project is stalled, waiting for action from the Navajo Nation.</p>
<p>Navajo President Ben Shelly, an original backer of the project,  had given developers until the end of the year to muster tribal support  for Grand Canyon Escalade.</p>
<p>While developers are hopeful, pointing to the approval by the  Bodaway/Gap chapter and to a petition supporting the project that Crank  said collected 2,700 signatures, they have also pushed back their  projected opening date from 2015 to 2016.</p>
