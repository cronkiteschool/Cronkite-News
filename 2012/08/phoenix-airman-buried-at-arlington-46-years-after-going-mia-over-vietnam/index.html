      <p>WASHINGTON &#8211; Air Force Lt. Col. Charles M. Walling was flying his F-4C over Vietnam 46 years ago when the Phoenix resident disappeared over Song Be Province, leaving behind a pregnant wife and a 22-month-old son.</p>
<p>Jeff Walling said it was hard for him and his younger brother, Mike, to grow up in a state of &#8220;limbo,&#8221; not knowing what had happened to their father.</p>
<p>The Scottsdale residents got some closure when their father&#8217;s remains were found in 2010 and later identified, and he was buried in June.</p>
<p>On Wednesday &#8211; the 46th anniversary of the day Walling and a fellow airman disappeared &#8211; the two were honored in a group burial ceremony with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery.</p>
<p>Walling and Maj. Aado Kommendant, of Lakewood, N.J., were on a close-air-support mission over Vietnam when their plane crashed on Aug. 8, 1966.</p>
<p>Other Americans in the area said they saw the plane crash but did not see any parachutes deploy, the <a href="http://www.defense.gov/releases/release.aspx?releaseid=15500" target="_blank">Pentagon said</a>. Search-and-rescue efforts in the days following the crash were unsuccessful.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was very tough, not growing up with our father,&#8221; Jeff Walling said Wednesday. &#8220;Father&#8217;s Day was always a day I didn&#8217;t look forward to.&#8221;</p>
<p>Walling said his father was born and raised in Phoenix. He went to Camelback High School, where he was a member of its second graduating class, and went on to attend Arizona State University.</p>
<p>He joined the Air Force after graduating from ASU, and was stationed in Tucson and Florida before volunteering to be a replacement pilot in Vietnam.</p>
<p>He was deployed to Vietnam in June 1966, Jeff Walling said, and was on his 40th mission when he died.</p>
<p>In 1992, a joint U.S.-Socialist Republic of Vietnam team investigated the area near the crash, the Pentagon said, and interviewed a local citizen who had recovered aircraft pieces from the site.</p>
<p>The Pentagon said the team went back in 1994 and excavated the site, recovering military equipment and a metal ID tag with Walling&#8217;s name on it.</p>
<p>In 2010, the site was excavated once again and additional evidence was found, including human remains. <a href="http://www.dtic.mil/dpmo/" target="_blank">Scientists</a> later used circumstantial and material evidence to identify some of the remains as Walling&#8217;s.</p>
<p>When Jeff Walling received the news that his father&#8217;s remains had been found, he said it felt like the &#8220;end of a journey.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was great,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Mike and I say it&#8217;s like winning the lottery.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jeff Walling said the identification came too late for his mother, Julie, who died in 2005. Walling, who attended Wednesday&#8217;s group burial in Arlington, and said it was &#8220;very meaningful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We can look forward to Father&#8217;s Day now,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and speaking of my father and the legacy he left us.&#8221;</p>
