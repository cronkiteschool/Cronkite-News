      <p>LONDON – U.S. Olympic swimmer Natalie Coughlin now has a deep appreciation for how much Title IX has impacted her life, but, partly because of the law&#8217;s effectiveness, that wasn&#8217;t always the case.</p>
<p>&#8220;I completely took it for granted,&#8221; Coughlin said in panel discussion on women athletes. &#8220;I remember watching the 1988 games and looking up to Janet Evans and Matt Biondi, and I never thought that women didn&#8217;t have the same opportunities in sport. It really wasn&#8217;t until I got involved with Women&#8217;s Sports Foundation where I started to realize all the opportunities that we&#8217;ve had because of things like Title IX.</p>
<p>&#8220;Title IX has benefited me tremendously because if it wasn&#8217;t for college swimming, I wouldn&#8217;t have gotten any of my Olympic medals &#8230; If college swimming didn&#8217;t exist, I would have never gone beyond high school.&#8221;</p>
<p>Title IX, which became law in 1976, mandated equal opportunity for women in sports and has changed the face of sports.</p>
<p>Coughlin won her 12th Olympic medal in London, tying the record previously set by American swimmers Jenny Thompson and Dara Torres for the most career Olympic medals won by a female U.S. athlete.</p>
<p>Coughlin’s fellow panelists, shooter Kim Rhode, gold medal rower Esther Lofgren, two-time gold medalist fencer Mariel Zagunis and basketball player Teresa Edwards, described similar experiences. The women also said a big reason behind their can-do attitudes was the support of their parents and families.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t really comprehend the struggles that women were going through because, for me, it wasn&#8217;t a matter of you can or you can&#8217;t,&#8221; Zagunis said.  &#8220;I was going to do it because I&#8217;ve been told I can and no one&#8217;s stopping me so far, so I&#8217;m going to take this as far as I can go.&#8221;</p>
<p>Edwards had a better understanding of the struggles of women athletes by her second Olympics, but the first time around she didn&#8217;t give it much thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was the youngest one on the basketball team in &#8217;84, and I had no idea what I was and what we were doing,&#8221; she said. &#8220;All I know is no one ever told me I couldn&#8217;t be a part of something that big, so I went along and enjoyed the ride.&#8221;</p>
<p>The audiences may be smaller for some women&#8217;s events, and women typically have slower times than their male counterparts because of physiological differences, but the panelists, each of whom has at least one gold medal, felt those discrepancies didn&#8217;t mean they were inferior competitors.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not afraid to get sweaty or smelly or dirty,&#8221; Zagunis said. &#8220;You&#8217;re just as much of an athlete as everyone else is, you&#8217;re going for the same goal.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rhode, a five-time medalist who recently tied the world record and won gold in skeet shooting by hitting 99 of 100 clay pigeons, had a unique perspective on competing with men.</p>
<p>&#8220;[Shooting is] one of the few sports that we can truly compete on an equal playing field. It doesn&#8217;t matter about your size, your strength, your stature,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>When the Olympics first included women in shooting, men and women competed in the same events. That lasted until the 1996 games.</p>
<p>Competing against men was normal for her, Rhode said. She has done so ever since she was a young girl, though growing up there were some men who weren&#8217;t used to competing with her.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s been some funny moments,&#8221; she said. &#8220;When I was a kid, I can remember a gentleman saying that, &#8216;It&#8217;s a lose-lose because she&#8217;s 10 years old and she&#8217;s a girl. Either way, I&#8217;m getting beat by a 10-year-old or by a girl.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
