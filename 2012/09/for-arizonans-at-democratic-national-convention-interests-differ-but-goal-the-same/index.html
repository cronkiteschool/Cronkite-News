</div></div><p>CHARLOTTE, N.C. – Trailed by her husband, Mikel, who carried a pink guitar case bearing the message &#8220;Tell the Right They&#8217;re WRONG,&#8221; Beth Weisser of Kingman arrived Sunday to serve as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention.</p>
<p>In addition to looking forward to supporting education as a teacher, she relished the prospect of being around like-minded people, as Republicans vastly outnumber Democrats in Mohave County.</p>
<p>She is running for state Senate, while her husband, also a teacher, is running as a Democrat for the U.S. House.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where we live, you don&#8217;t see a blue sky, you see a red sky,&#8221; Beth Weisser said. &#8220;To be around honest Democrats and progressives and talk politics and policy, it recharges the batteries.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so it went as dozens of delegates checked into the Hilton Garden Inn Charlotte/Ayrsley to begin a week of state delegation breakfasts, caucus and council meetings and events on the convention floor.</p>
<p>Sandra Kennedy, a member of Arizona Corporation  Commission, said she&#8217;ll focus as a delegate on women&#8217;s issues, seniors and health care.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you look at where Congress has gone in the last two years, women&#8217;s and senior issues have been on the back burner,&#8221; Kennedy said. &#8220;Our voices are not being heard. Men who want to force their beliefs on our rights is not what we want to see.&#8221;</p>
<p>Virgel Cain, a delegate from Cave Creek, arrived with his wife, Marcia, and wearing a T-shirt reading &#8220;Veteran and military families for Obama.&#8221; Having served in the U.S. Navy during the Vietnam War, he said veterans&#8217; and women&#8217;s issues are paramount.</p>
<p>Cain, who is unemployed after working in retail, praised President Barack Obama for scaling back the war in Iraq and offering &#8220;a glimpse of the light at the end of the tunnel in Afghanistan.&#8221;</p>
<p>Frank Camacho, spokesman for the Arizona Democratic Party, said the convention allows the state&#8217;s Democrats to reconnect with their national brethren and reminds them why they&#8217;re Democrats. Despite Republicans holding majorities in the state Legislature, the congressional delegation and the governor&#8217;s office, Arizona may well wind up electing a Democratic U.S. senator and Democratic majority in the U.S. House, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact that we even see it as a realistic opportunity dispels any notion that Arizona is strictly a red state,&#8221; Camacho said.</p>
<p>Richard Carmona, the former U.S. surgeon general opposing U.S. Rep. Jeff Flake for Senate, isn&#8217;t scheduled to attend the convention. Neither are Kyrsten Sinema and Ann Kirkpatrick, who are considered to have good chances of winning U.S. House seats in Arizona&#8217;s redrawn congressional districts.</p>
<p>Sharon Stewart, a retiree from Phoenix, said she wants to leave ready to help Democrats win in November.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope to get the kind of information needed to fire up voters,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Stewart said she&#8217;s always happy to spend time in the company of Arizona Democrats, a group she called just as engaged as its Republican counterpart.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is vibrant,&#8221; she said, &#8220;just smaller.&#8221;</p>
