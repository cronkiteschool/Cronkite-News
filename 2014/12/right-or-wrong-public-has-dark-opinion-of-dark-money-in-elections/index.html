<p><a href="../arizona-cited-as-a-special-place-for-dark-money-operations-2/index.html" target="_blank">Arizona cites as a "special place" for dark-money operations</a></p>
</div></div><p><span style="font-size: 13px;">WASHINGTON &#8211; Bethany Braley heads a nonprofit organization promoting cowboy culture, a job that has everything to do with preserving a slice of American heritage and nothing to do with politics.</span></p>
<p>But get the Prescott Valley resident talking about the current state of campaign finance, and it&#8217;s clear she has been giving politics a lot of thought lately.</p>
<p>Braley uses terms like &#8220;disgusting&#8221; to describe the record-setting influx of so-called dark money into this year&#8217;s elections, a trend that has left her feeling &#8220;dirty and personally degraded.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems to me it&#8217;s no longer a democracy,&#8221; said Braley, who says she make it a point to keep her politics out of her day job. &#8220;It&#8217;s a political machine dominated by the wealthy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Braley is not the only one who feels that way.</p>
<p>As dark-money spending reached what appeared to be record levels this fall, and with little sign of abating, polls showed staggeringly high numbers of Americans deeply troubled by the practice.</p>
<p>A recent bipartisan poll found that 80 percent of voters have a problem with what they see as &#8220;political operatives, wealthy donors and organizations abusing and taking advantage&#8221; of unclear IRS rules governing political activities of nonprofit organizations.</p>
<p>That worry stretched across party lines: 88 percent of Democrats, 84 percent of independents and 72 percent of Republicans in the poll were concerned about the consequences of unclear IRS rules for campaign spending.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.citizen.org/documents/Memo IRSrulemaking f 093014.pdf" target="_blank">The survey</a> of 800 likely voters was conducted in late July for Public Citizen by Democratic polling firm Lake Research Partners and its Republican counterparts at Chesapeake Beach Consulting.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were surprised by how robust the reaction was,&#8221; said Lisa Gilbert of Public Citizen, a consumer-rights advocacy nonprofit.</p>
<p>The technical term for the &#8220;dark money&#8221; groups that Braley and others are worried about is &#8220;<a href="http://www.irs.gov/Charities-&amp;-Non-Profits/Other-Non-Profits/Social-Welfare-Organizations" target="_blank">social welfare</a>&#8221; organization. Set up under section <a href="http://www.irs.gov/Charities-%26-Non-Profits/Other-Non-Profits/Types-of-Organizations-Exempt-under-Section-501(c)(4)" target="_blank">501(c)(4)</a> of the federal tax code, nonprofit social welfare outfits can engage in political activities as long as they spend less than 50 percent of their funds on politics.</p>
<p>But unlike traditional campaign accounts, nothing in current campaign-finance or tax laws requires 501(c)(4) groups to make the names of their financial backers public &#8211; hence the &#8220;dark money&#8221; label.</p>
<p>The groups have their roots in the Eisenhower era, but became increasingly influential after recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions &#8211; <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/05pdf/04-1581.pdf" target="_blank">Wisconsin Right to Life</a> v. Federal Election Commission and <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-205.pdf" target="_blank">Citizens United</a> v. Federal Election Commission &#8211; that chipped away at federal laws limiting outside election spending.</p>
<p>The result is a lot more money going to elections with a lot less certainty about where it came from.</p>
<p>&#8220;People agree the IRS should do rules that will deal with the issue,&#8221; said Gilbert, director of Public Citizen&#8217;s Congress Watch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Disgust is at an all-time high with government, with the process,&#8221; she said. &#8220;People are more aware and more disenfranchised.</p>
<p>&#8220;It almost doesn&#8217;t matter what you talk about &#8230; people think it&#8217;s not working and they want it to work,&#8221; Gilbert said.</p>
<p>But not everyone agrees that the system isn&#8217;t working. Concerns about the influence of dark money are &#8220;significantly overblown&#8221; in the media and among the public at large, said Ilya Shapiro of the libertarian <a href="http://www.cato.org/" target="_blank">Cato Institute</a>.</p>
<p>He said the public perception that Fortune 500 companies are buying elections is &#8220;100 percent wrong,&#8221; noting that for-profit corporations are reluctant to risk alienating candidates by getting involved in campaigns.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think there&#8217;s a lot of misunderstanding &#8230; about how much money there is and how elections work,&#8221; said Shapiro, Cato&#8217;s senior fellow in constitutional studies. He noted that Americans typically spend more on Halloween candy than is spent on elections, for example.</p>
<p>Shapiro concedes that while &#8220;there might be some of that&#8221; activity where corporations contribute to politically active nonprofits, it is already possible to follow the money through publicly available corporate filings.</p>
<p>&#8220;You look at their accounting to see how much they spend on political campaigning or social welfare organizations, you can piece it together,&#8221; Shapiro said, rejecting calls for more reporting.</p>
<p>Some Arizona voters appear to agree with Shapiro.</p>
<p>In a response to an online query from Cronkite News&#8217; Public Insight Network, Julie Them of Peoria said mandatory disclosure of dark-money contributors &#8220;stifles freedom of expression and can be used to harass the donors by radicals.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tucson resident Bob Benzinger shares that worry.</p>
<p>&#8220;If it becomes unsafe, if you&#8217;re getting fired or harassed for your political opinions, you start to think anonymity is your preferred option,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Despite such worries, Gilbert and others cite the recent polls as evidence that voters consistently oppose the influence of money in politics and support solutions to curb it.</p>
<p>In a <a href="http://www.tulchinresearch.com/2013/12/09/new-national-survey-results-public-demands-anti-corruption-measures/#more-1782" target="_blank">2013 poll</a> by MFour and Tulchin Research, for example, 92 percent of voters said it is important that &#8220;our elected leaders reduce the influence of money in political elections.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no question that Americans oppose the influence money has on our electoral system &#8211; from which candidates appear on the ballot to what elected officials do once in office,&#8221; said <a href="https://rethinkmedia.org/" target="_blank">ReThink</a> Media&#8217;s Scott Swenson in a memo summarizing several years&#8217; worth of polling on the topic.</p>
<p>Braley said it became clear to her during this year&#8217;s campaigns that voters are &#8220;in a losing battle&#8221; against wealthy contributors who are bankrolling political advertisements.</p>
<p>Benzinger said that, on principle, he strongly supports the idea that political donors should be disclosed.</p>
<p>A retired Foreign Service officer with an accounting degree, one of his jobs at the State Department was inspecting embassies all over the world. He said his views on dark-money reforms are a product of that background.</p>
<p>&#8220;The devil&#8217;s in the details,&#8221; Benzinger said of proposals calling for more transparency in political donations. &#8220;Whether I would be for it would depend on how it&#8217;s written and how it could be interpreted or abused.&#8221;</p>
