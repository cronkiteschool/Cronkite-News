      <div class="related_stories"><div class="glance_box_headline_in_page">Reading, writing, 'rithmetic - retail?</div><div class="glance_box_in_page"><p>Families shopping for back-to-school supplies can expect to see increases across the board this year, according to estimates from the National Retail Federation.</p>
<p>• Experts estimate that more than $26.5 billion will be spent on clothing, shoes, supplies and electronics in the 2014 back-to-school shopping season.</p>
<p>• Spending per household is expected to rise by 5 percent compared to last year, even though total spending will fall slightly because of a smaller number of students.</p>
<p>• More than $8.4 billon will be spent on electronics, according to the estimates.</p>
<p>• Electronics sales are expected to increase by 7 percent from last year.</p>
<p>• The average family is expected to spend about $212.35 on electronics, compared to last year's $199.05.</p>
<p>• For K-12 grades, high school students are expected to spend the most on electronics, estimated total spending at $229.</p>
<p>• Spending on school supplies is expected to grow 12 percent this year, to an average of $101.18 per family compared with last year's $90.49.</p>
<p>• 68 percent of shoppers plan to buy from discount stores while 54.4 percent will shop at department and brand-name stores.</p>
</div></div><p><span style="font-size: 13px;">WASHINGTON &#8211; Chandler mom Lindsay Barnes already knows what the National Retail Federation is reporting in a recent study &#8211; it costs a lot to send kids back to school.</span></p>
<p>The federation said this month that families will spend an average of $101.18 per student for school supplies alone, a 12 percent increase from last year. When clothes, shoes and electronics are included, the tab runs to $669.28 per family with kids in kindergarten through high school, <a href="https://nrf.com/sites/default/files/BTS 7-09-14 press.pdf" target="_blank">its data showed</a>.</p>
<p>Barnes said she is &#8220;beyond dreading&#8221; back-to-school shopping for her Kyrene School District second-grader. She is particularly concerned by the amount of classroom supplies she expects she will have to buy, after getting a list last summer requesting &#8220;a ridiculous amount of supplies.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They wanted something like 72 No. 2 pencils,&#8221; Barnes said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see why a first-grader would need that many pencils. I don&#8217;t even think I&#8217;ve used 72 pencils in my entire life.&#8221;</p>
<p>The retail <a href="https://nrf.com/media/press-releases/demand-clothing-supplies-electronics-drives-schoolcollege-spending" target="_blank">federation report</a> speculated that one reason for the increase in school-supply spending could be &#8220;school districts&#8217; growing requests for classroom supply contributions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I honestly feel like we&#8217;re footing the bill for the entire school,&#8221; Barnes said. &#8220;It didn&#8217;t seem fair.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mandy Taylor, who teaches sixth grade in the Phoenix area, said she understands parents&#8217; frustrations because she is in the same boat. Taylor said she sends about $500 of her own money each year on classroom basics such as pens, paper and &#8220;inspirational posters.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am very appreciative to parents that are willing to spend the extra dollar and help out,&#8221; said Taylor, who said parents are never required to buy supplies, let alone specific brands. She asks parents to look at the supply lists as suggestions.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it may seem ludicrous and a bit ridiculous&#8221; to ask for specific products, she said. &#8220;But we go through a lot, mainly pencils, and the name brands, like Crayola, hold up better. We know they will last all year.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kyrene.org/Page/1" target="_blank">Kyrene Schools</a> spokeswoman Nancy Dudenhoefer said teachers have to ask because there&#8217;s only so much in the budget for supplies. The state only provides &#8220;a certain number of funds and that doesn&#8217;t go to pencils,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Ashley Dammen, an Arizona <a href="http://www.azed.gov/" target="_blank">Department of Education</a> spokeswoman, said the state provides funds to each district for classroom resources but it has &#8220;no requirement for schools to provide teachers with supplies.&#8221; The state leaves it to the districts to decide &#8220;how they spend those funds,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>In the Kyrene schools, that money goes to things like textbooks and computers, Dudenhoefer said.</p>
<p>Alyssa Martin, a first-grade teacher at another Kyrene district school, said she got a $150 Target gift card from the district as a first-time teacher last year, but still spent about $600 of her own money getting her classroom together.</p>
<p>&#8220;The district gives what they can. But things get dirty and little kids go through things fast,&#8221; said Martin, who said she relies on parents for help.</p>
<p>She said most parents are willing to help fulfill her &#8220;wish lists,&#8221; which include traditional supplies, like markers and crayons, as well as cleaning products like Lysol Wipes and paper towels.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t require anything, but I can&#8217;t do it all myself,&#8221; Martin said. &#8220;I am very grateful for the parents who help me out.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just elementary schools parents who feel the pinch.</p>
<p>Carly Tatroe said she was not surprised by having to spend $125 on school supplies last year for her then-eighth-grade daughter, Brielle. But she was &#8220;shocked&#8221; to see the same <a href="http://www.husd.org/site/default.aspx?PageID=4225" target="_blank">Higley Unified</a> School District that asked for the supplies turn around and give every student in her Brielle&#8217;s class an iPad for classroom use.</p>
<p>&#8220;I found it ironic that they had iPads, but no copy paper,&#8221; said Tatroe, who said last year&#8217;s list included a request for 200 staples from every student.</p>
<p>With Brielle starting high school Monday, Tatroe is gearing up for a back-to-school shopping trip &#8211; but expects to have &#8220;less incentive&#8221; if the new school offers iPads to students.</p>
<p>Jill Hildwine has seen the issue from both side, as mother of four children and as a former teacher who now substitutes in <a href="http://www.gilbertschools.net/site/default.aspx?PageID=1" target="_blank">Gilbert Public Schools</a>.</p>
<p>Hildwine &#8220;grumbles about school-supply shopping&#8221; but said she does it because she knows that the teachers need help &#8211; even though, like the other parents, she feels she is over-spending.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to be a good parent and help out, but to look at a list like that and I don.t have a bazillon dollars to spend on that,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It puts a bad taste in my mouth.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Hildwine, who will have a fifth- and a seventh-grader this fall, said she expects the spending to rise as her two toddlers reach school age.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to have to get, like, a part-time job,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;m not opposed to that. I&#8217;m sure the older the boys get, the more I will have to spend.&#8221;</p>
