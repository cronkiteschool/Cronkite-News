      <p><span style="font-size: 13px;">WASHINGTON &#8211; Pam Simon said she remembers only part of what happened that January day in the parking lot of a Tucson supermarket.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;A person appeared &#8230; and shots began to be fired,&#8221; Simon said. &#8220;You kind of go into another reality.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was one of the first to be hit when a gunman opened fire at a &#8220;Congress in Your Corner&#8221; event held by then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, for whom Simon was working as a staffer. Six people were killed and she and Giffords were among 13 wounded.</p>
<p>Until that day, Simon, a one-time middle school teacher in Tucson, never thought gun violence was an important issue. Until that day, she said, gun violence was always something that happened to other people.</p>
<p>Since that day, Simon has become an activist with organizations across the country that work to prevent gun violence.</p>
<p>Her efforts brought her to Washington this week, where she was acknowledged Thursday as a White House &#8220;<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/champions" target="_blank">Champion of Change</a>&#8221; for her work on gun control.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m really happy that she was honored,&#8221; said Lizzie Ulmer of <a href="http://mayorsagainstillegalguns.org/html/home/home.shtml" target="_blank">Mayors Against</a> Illegal Guns, one of the many groups Simon has worked with. &#8220;She&#8217;s a role model for other survivors.&#8221;</p>
<p>Simon said she considers the White House honor as recognition not just for her but for all the survivors of the Tucson shooting.</p>
<p>Rep. Ron Barber, D-Tucson, remembers the Tucson shooting as a &#8220;horrifying day &#8230; a day that changed all of our lives.&#8221; He was on Giffords&#8217; staff and was at the event where he was among the wounded.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve become close, like family,&#8221; said Barber, who succeeded Giffords in office. &#8220;Pam &#8230; has been a major part in leading the survivor group.&#8221;</p>
<p>Simon remembers ducking when the shooting began that day. A bullet went through her hand, into her chest, passed over her heart and lodged in her hip. After she fell, she couldn&#8217;t see what was happening but heard people rushing to help the victims.</p>
<p>Since then, she has been active with <a href="http://momsdemandaction.org/" target="_blank">Moms Demand Action</a> and <a href="http://www.azfgs.com/" target="_blank">Arizonans for Gun Safety</a>, as well as the mayors&#8217; group. During the last presidential election, she helped Mayors Against Illegal Guns &#8220;demand a plan&#8221; from the candidates for reducing gun violence.</p>
<p>She accused gun-rights groups of scaring people into thinking that any gun-control measure means they are losing their rights.</p>
<p>That drew a sharp rebuke from Larry Pratt, executive director of <a href="http://gunowners.org/" target="_blank">Gun Owners</a> of America, who called gun control &#8220;a criminal&#8217;s friend.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe she&#8217;s losing the argument, or else this would be a more dangerous country to live in,&#8221; said Pratt of Simon&#8217;s efforts. He said the country is safer with more guns, not fewer.</p>
<p>But Simon said the numbers argue otherwise. In addition to the high-profile mass shootings &#8211; Tucson, Columbine, Aurora, Sandy Hook and this week&#8217;s Fort Hood attack &#8211; she said that gun violence claims 33 people every day in the U.S.</p>
<p>Simon said she is now focusing her efforts on improving mental health resources and bringing background checks on potential gun owners to law in every state.</p>
<p>She said 16 states and Washington, D.C., now require background checks on anyone purchasing a gun, what she called a &#8220;small step&#8221; to a safer country.</p>
<p>She praised President Barack Obama for taking up the gun-control fight but said there is still much to be done &#8211; and vowed to keep working, despite relatively little progress since she was shot.</p>
<p>Even though she said there have been some setbacks on gun-control legislation, &#8220;we&#8217;ve made great headway.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is going to be one of those issues that is not going to be solved overnight,&#8221; said Simon, who thinks that in such long battles, it is important &#8220;that we celebrate the small steps.&#8221;</p>
<p>Barber, who called the shooting a unifying experience for those involved, said he wanted to commend Simon for &#8220;her courage and her energy&#8221; in the years since that day.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very proud of her &#8230; she didn&#8217;t let that day define her,&#8221; he said.</p>
