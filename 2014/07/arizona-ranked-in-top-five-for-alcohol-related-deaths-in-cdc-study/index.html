      <div class="related_stories"><div class="glance_box_headline_in_page">Deadlly drinking</div><div class="glance_box_in_page"><p>A recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study said Arizona tied for fourth-highest rate of alcohol-related deaths from 2006-2010 and was fifth for such deaths per 100,000 in the same period.</p>
<p>Working age (20-64) population deaths attributed to alcohol from 2006-2010:</p>
<p>• New Mexico, 16.4 percent</p>
<p>• Alaska, 15.9 percent</p>
<p>• Colorado, 14.2 percent</p>
<p>• <b>Arizona,</b> 13.4 percent</p>
<p>• Wyoming, 13.4 percent</p>
<p>Deaths linked to alcohol per 100,000 people, age-adjusted, from 2006-2010:</p>
<p>• New Mexico, 51.2 per 100,000</p>
<p>• Alaska, 41.1 per 100,000</p>
<p>• Montana, 37.7 per 100,000</p>
<p>• Wyoming, 37.5 per 100,000</p>
<p>• <b>Arizona,</b> 37.2 per 100,000</p>
</div></div><p><span style="font-size: 13px;">WASHINGTON &#8211; Arizona was tied for the fourth-highest rate of alcohol-related deaths among its working-age population from 2006 to 2010, according to a recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study.</span></p>
<p>The June report said 13.4 percent of all deaths to working-age residents were attributable to alcohol for that period, up slightly from 13.1 percent during the five years prior.</p>
<p>The 2006-2010 rate for the state was well above the national average of 9.8 percent for the period, and tied with Wyoming for fourth-worst, behind only New Mexico, Alaska and Colorado.</p>
<p>The same <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2014/pdf/13_0293.pdf" target="_blank">CDC study</a> said Arizona ranked fifth in the nation for the rate of alcohol-related deaths per 100,000 people in the overall population, when the population is adjusted to parallel the nation&#8217;s age. Only Alaska, Montana, New Mexico and Wyoming had higher overall rates.</p>
<p>The study looked at 54 different alcohol-attributed causes of death, including everything from liver disease to falls and accidents to suicide.</p>
<p>Mandy Stahre, one of the co-authors of the report, cited several possible reasons that one state might perform worse than another, including poverty, alcohol-enforcement policies and religious views toward alcohol.</p>
<p>Stahre, an epidemiologist for the Washington State Department of Health, also said there is a &#8220;regionality&#8221; to the findings that includes the fact that many troubled states are largely rural.</p>
<p>&#8220;When dealing with a state like Arizona or New Mexico, you got some areas that are just very rural,&#8221; Stahre said. &#8220;Access to care can be a huge issue.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not everyone has a trauma center or hospital nearby to go to after a vehicle crash or serious accident, she said.</p>
<p>But Deni Carise, who has worked in substance-abuse treatment for more than 25 years, said there are no easy answers to why alcohol-related deaths are a problem in Arizona.</p>
<p>Carise is chief clinic advisor for <a href="http://sierratucson.crchealth.com/" target="_blank">Sierra Tucson</a>, a treatment facility for addiction. She speculates that one possible reason for high numbers of alcohol-related deaths &#8211; in Arizona and in other states &#8211; is the fact that alcoholics and their families have no voice in their communities.</p>
<p>&#8220;When your family member is an addict or an alcoholic it&#8217;s shameful to admit that,&#8221; Carise said.</p>
<p>And for people in recovery, she said, being open about their struggles with addiction can cost them their jobs, lessen their likelihood of even getting a job and affect their ability to get life insurance.</p>
<p>While there is no one cause, Carise said, there are &#8220;a hundred ways&#8221; that alcoholism can affect a community: a drain on health-care resources, an overlap of alcohol addiction and homelessness, and children more likely to end up in foster care, among other effects.</p>
<p>Reducing the amount of alcohol-related deaths and getting help for people with substance-abuse problems is something everyone should care about, she said, because &#8220;it affects them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When we let people get into an addiction and continue an addiction in their alcoholism, the community loses that way,&#8221; Carise said.</p>
<p>The Arizona Department of Health Services is working to prevent alcoholism before it even starts, said the department&#8217;s Cory Nelson, by focusing efforts on the state&#8217;s youth.</p>
<p>Nelson, the deputy director at the Division of <a href="http://www.azdhs.gov/bhs/" target="_blank">Behavioral Health Services</a>, said the goal is to prevent risks that could lead to excessive drinking and alcohol-related deaths down the road.</p>
<p>&#8220;The youth are one of our great targets because of the significant long-term impacts you can have,&#8221; Nelson said. &#8220;Whereas you have a little less time to work with the adult population.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said alcohol-attributable deaths could be reduced if they were addressed as a public health issue like other chronic illnesses, such as diabetes and heart disease.</p>
<p>For those ailments, he said, there is &#8220;anywhere between a 70 percent to an 85 percent treatment or screening rate.&#8221; But when you look at substance-abuse disorders, &#8220;you&#8217;re looking at about an 18 to 20 percent screening rate,&#8221; Nelson said.</p>
<p>Despite the problems now, Carise holds out hopes for the future.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is more medication being developed, more types of treatments being delivered and more treatment programs opening,&#8221; said Carise, who also thinks expanded services could come under the Affordable Care Act.</p>
<p>The new benefits will provide &#8220;more options for people that are still suffering,&#8221; she said.</p>
