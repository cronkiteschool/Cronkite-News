      <p><span style="font-size: 13px;">WASHINGTON &#8211; Thirty-eight weeks pregnant and on bed-rest with her fifth child, Glendale resident Angela Warren has to rely on her other four children to help run the household.</span></p>
<p>Her husband, Matt, can&#8217;t break away from his full-time job right now &#8211; and their budget can&#8217;t take the hit of losing both his salary and hers.</p>
<p>Even though the federal Family and Medical Leave Act guarantees most workers 12 weeks of leave for events like the birth of a baby, that leave is unpaid. And that can put Arizona working families like the Warrens in a bind.</p>
<p>&#8220;The FMLA even in itself is not super comprehensive or adequate,&#8221; Warren said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not necessarily realistic for people to be able to take 12 weeks unpaid. I don&#8217;t know a lot of people that can do that.&#8221;</p>
<p>While other states may grant more generous protections, Arizona is one of many that does not expand the benefits of FMLA &#8211; one reason it earned a grade of F on a recent <a href="http://www.nationalpartnership.org/research-library/work-family/expecting-better-2014.pdf" target="_blank">report card</a> on &#8220;family-friendly&#8221; workplace policies.</p>
<p>But Arizona was not alone.</p>
<p>In &#8220;Expecting Better,&#8221; a recent report from the National Partnership for Women and Families, 17 states got an F for their family leave policies, their protections against pregnancy discrimination and some nursing mothers&#8217; rights under the Fair Labor Standards Act.</p>
<p>California got the highest grade, an A-, for its &#8220;first-in-the-nation paid family leave law.&#8221; Connecticut, Hawaii, New Jersey and the District of Columbia all got a B+ for their policies giving workers access to paid sick days, paid family leave and paid medical leave for pregnancy.</p>
<p>&#8220;But right now, Arizona doesn&#8217;t do any of those things, nor does it guarantee leave rights or the right to reasonable accommodations for pregnant women in the workplace,&#8221; said Vicki Shabo, vice president of the <a href="http://www.nationalpartnership.org/" target="_blank">National Partnership</a> for Women and Families.</p>
<p>Businesses can offer such provisions, and should be allowed to make the decision to do so, said Garrick Taylor, spokesman for the <a href="http://www.azchamber.com/" target="_blank">Arizona Chamber</a> of Commerce. The chamber would prefer letting businesses in the state deal with workplace policies internally rather than reacting to a government mandate.</p>
<p>&#8220;The chamber has supported policies that leave these sorts of workplace issues, such as family and medical leave, in the hands of the employer to work out with their employees,&#8221; said Taylor.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.dol.gov/whd/fmla/" target="_blank">FMLA</a> applies to businesses that have at least 50 employees within a 75-mile radius. To be eligible for leave under the act, a worker at such a business must have worked there at least one year and must have clocked at least 1,250 hours in the year before they start their leave.</p>
<p>The guidelines apply to 59 percent of the workforce nationally, excluding about 4 in 10 workers, according to the report.</p>
<p>Rick Murray, chief executive officer of the Arizona <a href="http://www.asba.com/" target="_blank">Small Business Association</a>, said he thinks of FMLA guidelines as the floor for businesses with 50 employees or fewer to build upon.</p>
<p>&#8220;From our standpoint, it is really about letting the market dictate what those policies are going to be,&#8221; Murray said.</p>
<p>He said competition plays a role for small businesses in establishing workplace policies that are going to attract quality employees. There is much more attention given to employees in small businesses because of their close-knit work environments, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;When companies have to compete for employees, typically what you&#8217;re going to find is that they are going to be offering more than what is the minimum in regards to benefits,&#8221; Murray said.</p>
<p>The companies that choose not to meet the &#8220;floor&#8221; for benefits, he said, are the &#8220;businesses that perhaps are not competing very well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They just want to know what the minimum is, and they&#8217;ll provide that,&#8221; Murray said.</p>
<p>But even at the FMLA level of protection, Shabo said, families can be forced to choose between work and family when faced with the birth of a child or an unexpected family emergency.</p>
<p>&#8220;[Arizona's] private-sector workers and its public-sector workers are often forgoing pay, living paycheck to paycheck,&#8221; Shabo said.</p>
<p>&#8220;If they are not covered by the FMLA, they risk losing their jobs when they have a baby or need to take care of a family member,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Warren said her husband has seven days of paid leave he plans to use for the week after the baby is born, which &#8220;will wipe out his ability to take any days off if he does get sick sometime in the next year.&#8221;</p>
<p>Warren said she hopes state policymakers will make family-friendly workplace policies a priority &#8211; even if they won&#8217;t help her family right now.</p>
<p>&#8220;You think that you&#8217;re going to get to this point where it&#8217;s going to get easier, and the policies don&#8217;t allow for it to get easier,&#8221; she said. &#8220;There is a lot of work to be done.&#8221;</p>
