      <div class="related_stories"><div class="glance_box_headline_in_page">Expanding FMLA</div><div class="glance_box_in_page"><p>The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) entitles eligible employees of covered employers to take unpaid, job-protected leave for specified family and medical reasons, but it had only applied to married couples. The Labor Department has proposed expanding it to legally married same-sex couples.</p>
<p>FMLA allows up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for:<br />
• the birth of a child or care for a newborn;<br />
• adoption or foster care placement of a child;<br />
• caring for a seriously ill spouse, parent or child;<br />
• dealing the the employee's own medical problems.</p>
<p>FMLA would be expanded to same-sex couples by:<br />
• recognizing a marriage by the state where it was performed, not the state where a couple lives;<br />
• explicitly definig "spouse" to include those in same-sex or common-law marriages and some same-sex marriages performed abroad.</p>
<p>The changes would mean:<br />
• same-sex spouses could take FMLA leave to care for each other;<br />
• workers could take leave to for a same-sex spouse's stepchild;<br />
• workers could take leave to care for a parent's same-sex partner.</p>
<p>Public comment on the plan will be taken until Aug. 11.</p>
</div></div><p><span style="font-size: 13px;">WASHINGTON &#8211; Couples who were legally married in a state that recognizes same-sex unions might be given Family and Medical Leave Act benefits if they work in Arizona &#8211; even though the state does not recognize their marriage.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.dol.gov/whd/fmla/nprm-spouse/factsheet.htm" target="_blank">That proposal</a> from the Department of Labor is expected to have little practical impact in Arizona, but advocates still welcomed it for the emotional and political statement it makes.</p>
<p>&#8220;As these rules get implemented, people will see the impact of discriminatory laws on their neighbors, their coworkers and colleagues,&#8221; said Robin Maril, senior legislative counsel at Human <a href="http://www.hrc.org/" target="_blank">Rights Campaign</a>. She believes the shift could &#8220;really open people&#8217;s eyes&#8221; to the discrimination same-sex couples have faced.</p>
<p>The Labor Department in June proposed expanding FMLA benefits to legally married same-sex regardless of where they live. That proposal was part of the administration&#8217;s review of all federal benefits after last year&#8217;s Supreme <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-307_6j37.pdf" target="_blank">Court ruling</a> that struck down the Defense of Marriage Act, defining marriage as between one man and one woman, as unconstitutional.</p>
<p>First enacted in 1993, FMLA guarantees up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave to an employee for the birth of a child or to tend to an ailing family member. It only applies to businesses with more than 50 employees and workers who have been at their jobs for at least a year &#8211; and, so far, it has only applied to heterosexual married couples.</p>
<p>Couples would still have to be married, but would not have to be opposite sexes, under the Labor Department plan. A public comment period on the proposal runs through Aug. 11.</p>
<p>Even if enacted as proposed, observers said they did not expect big changes would be felt in Arizona.</p>
<p>The expanded policy would add &#8220;some sort of additional comfort or additional acknowledgment&#8221; that there is support for same-sex couples, said John Balitis, an attorney at the Phoenix-based law firm <a href="http://www.fclaw.com/locations/phoenix.cfm" target="_blank">Fennemore Craig</a>, who specializes in labor and employment issues.</p>
<p>Advocates do worry that the shift could have one unintended consequence &#8211; state lawmakers might use it as reason to keep from offering same-sex couples additional rights, such as the right to marry.</p>
<p>The legislature could say &#8220;there is no purpose in us spending any time recognizing that marriage because the federal government has extended the benefit no matter what,&#8221; Balitis said.</p>
<p>State lawmakers generated headlines earlier this year with passage of <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/legtext/51leg/2r/bills/sb1062s.pdf" target="_blank">SB 1062</a>, which would have let businesses deny service based on religious grounds, such as the owner&#8217;s opposition to homosexuality.</p>
<p>Much of the opposition to that law, ultimately vetoed by Gov. Jan Brewer, came from state business leaders. Balitis said he does not think that expanding FMLA benefits to same-sex couples is &#8220;particularly inconsistent&#8221; with the culture of Arizona business, and that companies in the state will adjust.</p>
<p>Garrick Taylor, spokesman for the <a href="http://www.azchamber.com/" target="_blank">Arizona Chamber</a> of Commerce, agreed. He said SB 1062 will continue to bring attention to the state&#8217;s businesses and how they treat same-sex couples.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think Arizona&#8217;s business community is likely going to have to contemplate the issues surrounding same-sex couples, and how they might affect workplace policies or leave policies,&#8221; Taylor said.</p>
<p>For Maril, expanding the benefits is just a matter of fairness.</p>
<p>She said it would provide an &#8220;extra bit of cushion&#8221; and promote mobility for workers and their same-sex spouses. She points to the simple fact that &#8220;people move states,&#8221; and this ruling will offer same-sex couples some flexibility when moving from a state that recognizes same-sex marriage.</p>
<p>&#8220;People move for all sorts of reasons and they shouldn&#8217;t have to give up those federal protections just because they moved,&#8221; she said.</p>
