      <p>WASHINGTON &#8211; The Department of Veterans Affairs formally removed Sharon Helman from her position as Phoenix VA healthcare director on Monday for &#8220;lack of oversight and misconduct&#8221; in the troubled operations at the facility.</p>
<p>Helman had been on paid leave since May 1, after a whistle-blower raised allegations that staff in Phoenix had manipulated records of patient wait times, boosting their own performance evaluations and endangering the health of veterans.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.va.gov/opa/pressrel/pressrelease.cfm?id=2662" target="_blank">The firing</a> Monday &#8211; almost a year after the beginning of the scandal that would eventually envelop the entire agency &#8211; followed months of complaints by lawmakers that the VA was dragging its feet in the investigation.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a step in the right direction, but Sharon Helman should have been fired long ago. Period,&#8221; Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick, D-Flagstaff, said in a statement Monday.</p>
<p>&#8220;Firing VA officials who manipulate the system, harm our veterans and violate our nation&#8217;s trust should be swift,&#8221; said the statement from Kirkpatrick, a member of the House Veterans&#8217; Affairs Committee.</p>
<p>The chairman of that committee, Rep. Jeff Miller, R-Fla., said in a statement Monday that Helman&#8217;s firing is a &#8220;positive step, but there are still many more VA scandal figures who also must be purged from the department&#8217;s payroll.&#8221;</p>
<p>The furor began in January when retired VA physician Samuel Foote brought documents to the committee showing that workers at the VA in Phoenix were manipulating patient-scheduling records to make it appear that veterans were getting care in a timely manner.</p>
<p>In reality, patients sometimes waited months for care, but fast wait-times were considered in employee performance reviews and directly affected their bonuses.</p>
<p>Foote&#8217;s allegations led to a probe of the Phoenix VA, which eventually sparked an investigation of VA facilities nationwide. The VA ultimately said it found similar problems at facilities across the country. And an <a href="http://www.va.gov/oig/pubs/VAOIG-14-02603-267.pdf" target="_blank">inspector general&#8217;s report</a> in August confirmed many of the problems at the Phoenix facility.</p>
<p>Helman was put on paid administrative leave May 1, and then-VA Secretary Eric Shinseki resigned May 31 as problems continued to come to light.</p>
<p>In response, Congress in August passed the Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act of 2014, <a href="https://www.congress.gov/113/plaws/publ146/PLAW-113publ146.pdf" target="_blank">a law that gave</a> the VA $17 billion in emergency funding for reform, along with greater authority to fire agency executives.</p>
<p>VA Secretary Robert MacDonald came under fire earlier this month for not using that new personnel authority to clean house. But the agency&#8217;s deliberate pace was defended by Deputy Secretary Sloan Gibson, who said the VA needed to work carefully on cases like Helman&#8217;s in order for its &#8220;actions to withstand appeal.&#8221;</p>
<p>The case against Helman was apparently strong enough to act Monday, nearly seven months after she was put on leave.</p>
<p>&#8220;This decision followed an investigation by the VA Office of Inspector General in which allegations of lack of oversight and other misconduct were substantiated,&#8221; the VA said in a statement Monday. MacDonald added that the department &#8220;will not tolerate&#8221; any more misconduct by its leaders.</p>
<p>American Legion National Commander Michael Helm intends to hold MacDonald to his word.</p>
<p>&#8220;We expect to see additional consequences, even criminal charges if they are warranted, for anyone who knowingly misled veterans and denied them access to medical services,&#8221; Helm said in a statement Monday.</p>
<p>Helm added that the journey toward accountability is &#8220;far from over,&#8221; and anyone responsible for the agency scandal must face consequences.</p>
<p>The Phoenix VA is currently being run by Glenn Grippen &#8211; its third interim director this year &#8211; but the VA said it is working &#8220;as quickly as possible&#8221; to find a permanent replacement for Helman.</p>
<p>Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Phoenix, said in a statement that a new leader needs to be able to bring increased stability and continuity to the facility. She also pointed out that Helman has been paid more than $90,000 while others have been doing her job.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a completely unacceptable use of taxpayer dollars that should instead go to providing care for veterans,&#8221; she said.</p>
