<p>Shortly after a judge struck down Arizona's ban on same-sex marriage, the Maricopa County Superior Court Clerk's office issued new marriage licenses that added the option of "spouse" to "bride" and "groom." Click above for a larger version.</p>
<hr>
Language of Arizona's law and Constitution defining marriage, and part of U.S. District Judge John Sedwick's decision overturning the state's same-sex marriage ban.</p>
<h4><b>What the law said:</b></h4>
<p>• <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/FormatDocument.asp?inDoc=/const/30/1.htm" target="_blank">Article 30,</a> section 1, Arizona Constitution: "Only a union of one man and one woman shall be valid or recognized as a marriage in this state."</p>
<p>• Arizona Revised Statues, <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/FormatDocument.asp?inDoc=/ars/25/00101.htm&amp;Title=25&amp;DocType=ARS" target="_blank">Section 25-101 (C)</a>: "Marriage between persons of the same sex is void and prohibited."</p>
<p>• Arizona Revised Statutes, <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/FormatDocument.asp?inDoc=/ars/25/00125.htm&amp;Title=25&amp;DocType=ARS" target="_blank">Section 25-125 (A)</a>: "A valid marriage is contracted by a male person and a female person with a proper marriage license who participate in a ceremony conducted by and in the presence of a person who is authorized to solemnize marriages and at which at least two witnesses who are at least eighteen years of age participate."</p>
<h4><b>What the court said:</b></h4>
<p>• "Article 30, Section 1, of the Arizona Constitution; Sections 25-101 (C) and 25-125 (A) are unconstitutional by virtue of the fact that they deny same-sex couples the equal protection of the law."</p>

<p><a href="../court-ruling-on-same-sex-marriages-lead-to-changes-in-other-laws/index.html">Court's ruling on same-sex marriage could lead to other state laws being struck down, expert says</a></p>
</div></div><p>Gay couples rushed to Arizona courthouses to get married Friday, just hours after a federal judge struck down the state&#8217;s ban on same-sex marriage as a violation of the right to equal protection.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge John Sedwick declared the ban <a href="https://www.scribd.com/doc/243375766/Connolly-Et-Al-v-Brewer-Et-Al" target="_blank">unconstitutional</a> early Friday and Attorney General Tom Horne said later in the morning that clerks could begin issuing marriage licenses immediately.</p>
<p>Horne &#8211; who had defended <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/FormatDocument.asp?inDoc=/ars/25/00125.htm&amp;Title=25&amp;DocType=ARS" target="_blank">two</a> state <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/FormatDocument.asp?inDoc=/ars/25/00101.htm&amp;Title=25&amp;DocType=ARS" target="_blank">laws</a> and a voter-approved constitutional <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/FormatDocument.asp?inDoc=/const/30/1.htm" target="_blank">amendment</a> banning gay marriage &#8211; was widely expected to appeal the judge&#8217;s ruling. But he said Friday that a legal challenge now would be &#8220;an exercise in futility&#8221; since Sedwick based his ruling on recent decisions by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
<p>The lightning-fast series of developments left some clerks scrambling to get the paperwork going for same-sex unions, while others in the state began issuing the licenses Friday.</p>
<p>Pima County Clerk of the Court Toni Hellon said her office started issuing licenses to same-sex couples right after Horne issued <a href="http://archive.azcentral.com/ic/pdf/horne-letter-clerk-court.pdf" target="_blank">his directive</a>, even though revised forms will not be available until Monday.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t want to hold people up until next week,&#8221; Hellon said. &#8220;People can mark out the words that don&#8217;t apply to them on the applications. On Monday, they can come back and get the official forms.&#8221;</p>
<p>In Maricopa County, college sweethearts Karen and Nelda Majors said they had been waiting 57 years for the chance to get married. Nelda Majors was the <a href="https://www.scribd.com/doc/243375519/Majors-v-Horne" target="_blank">lead plaintiff</a> in one of the two cases Sedwick ruled on Friday.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never would we have believed this would happen 57 years ago, because it was a time where you didn&#8217;t talk about it,&#8221; said Karen Majors, nee Bailey. &#8220;But it&#8217;s a wonderful day today.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite the longstanding furor over gay marriage, opponents were nowhere to be found Friday at the Maricopa clerk&#8217;s office, where the mood was upbeat. Maricopa Superior Court Clerk Michael Jeanes had <a href="https://www.scribd.com/doc/243381434/New-Maricopa-Marriage-Certificate" target="_blank">new license</a> application forms ready to go and began issuing licenses almost immediately after Horne gave the green light.</p>
<p>Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton made municipal court judges available Friday afternoon to perform same-sex marriages in his conference room and signed the marriage certificate as a witness for one couple.</p>
<p>&#8220;Being a witness, that&#8217;s the easiest thing I could do,&#8221; Stanton said. &#8220;It&#8217;s great. I&#8217;m honored to do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Phoenix Municipal Court Judge Kevin Kane, who officiated one of the weddings, said it was the first ceremony he has performed in his eight years on the bench.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was the first openly gay man on the bench, and people have asked me over the years if I would perform marriages for them,&#8221; Kane said. &#8220;I said, &#8216;I&#8217;m only going to perform marriages when it&#8217;s legal for everyone to get married.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;And that day has come today, and I&#8217;m very honored and proud to be a part of it,&#8221; Kane said.</p>
<p>Horne&#8217;s decision not to challenge Sedwick&#8217;s ruling capped almost two weeks of legal activity that began Oct. 6, when the Supreme Court refused to hear appeals of lower-court rulings that overturned same-sex marriage bans in five other states.</p>
<p>A day later, the 9th Circuit struck down similar bans in Nevada and Idaho. Because Arizona is in the 9th Circuit, Sedwick on Oct. 9 asked parties in two same-sex marriage cases before him to argue whether the appeals court ruling applied.</p>
<p>He ruled Friday that it did, saying, &#8220;This court is bound by the precedent set by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.&#8221; He added that it is &#8220;also clear&#8221; that the Supreme Court &#8220;will turn a deaf ear on any request for relief from the Ninth Circuit&#8217;s decision.&#8221;</p>
<p>Opponents of same-sex marriage, including Gov. Jan Brewer, reacted to Friday&#8217;s events with disappointment. Brewer called Sedwick&#8217;s ruling &#8220;deeply troubling.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Courts should not be in the business of making and changing laws based on their personal agendas,&#8221; <a href="http://azgovernor.gov/dms/upload/PR_101714_MarriageRuling.pdf" target="_blank">Brewer said</a> in a statement. &#8220;It is not the role of the judiciary to determine that same-sex marriages should be allowed. Historically and traditionally, that power belongs to the states, and to the people.&#8221;</p>
<p>The statement made no mention of an appeal, however, and Brewer&#8217;s office did not immediately respond to emailed questions about what steps she is considering.</p>
<p>The Center for Arizona Policy, a conservative lobbying group opposed to gay marriage, said Friday that the center currently has no plans to challenge the ruling.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve had no discussions to that effect,&#8221; spokesman Josh Kredit said.</p>
<p>Still, he said the center will continue working in support of traditional marriage. He likened the same-sex marriage fight to the decades-long battle to overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Forty-one years later, polls show a majority of Americans are pro-life,&#8221; Kredit said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not over. We&#8217;re going to work for a culture that sees the value of marriage between one man and one woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>But supporters of marriage equality welcomed the decisions from Sedwick and Horne.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is an exciting and historic day for Arizona,&#8221; said Jeremy Zegas, spokesman for Why Marriage Matters in Arizona, which supports same-sex marriage rights.</p>
<p>The group was hosting celebrations in Phoenix and Tucson Friday evening and organizing dozens of clergy members to begin officiating weddings across the state.</p>
<p>&#8220;It just shows that love is love and right is right,&#8221; Zegas said. &#8220;When couples make a commitment to one another and demand their constitutional freedoms, this is the result that we get.&#8221;</p>
