      <div class="related_stories"><div class="glance_box_headline_in_page">ASU hockey:</div><div class="glance_box_in_page"><p>• Arizona State Men’s Ice Hockey club got its informal start in the early 1980s through pickup games at Tower Ice Plaza in central Phoenix.</p>
<p>• The club became a Division II club team in the American Collegiate Hockey Association in the late 1980s.</p>
<p>• In 1993, General Manager Mike Hoffarth took the team to the Division I level.</p>
<p>• Between 1995-1998, the team had three straight national tournament appearances under head coach Gene Hammett. </p>
<p>• 2013-2014, the Sun Devils club won their first ACHA National Title with a season-best 38-2.</p>
</div></div><link href='http://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/soundcite/latest/css/player.css' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'><script type='text/javascript' src='http://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/soundcite/latest/js/soundcite.min.js'></script>TEMPE – While he doesn’t lead in goals or assists, junior forward Chris Blessing is providing inspiration on the ice that&#8217;s helped Arizona State’s men’s hockey team to a 8-0 start, according to head coach Greg Powers.
<p>Blessing was a part of the club team last season when the Sun Devils won their first-ever American Collegiate Hockey Association national title, but he hardly saw the ice and was almost cut from the roster.</p>
<p>“He was out of shape for the most part, especially for a kid who is out working on the ice this rigorously every day,” Powers said. “But he had so much talent and we could see it, so it was  frustrating as a coach to see a kid not use his talent to the best he could.” <span class="soundcite" data-url="http://cronkitenews.asu.edu/assets/images/14/10/15-somuchtalent.mp3" data-start="0" data-end="8000">listen</span></p>
<p>Blessing transferred to ASU after playing as a freshman for NCAA Division III University of Wisconsin-River Falls.  Between his move to Arizona and the offseason, he gained weight and lost a lot of his physical game.</p>
<p>“Hockey is definitely a mental game,” Blessing said. “But for me personally, I know that where I was physically before coming into this season. That’s what I really needed to change.”</p>
<p>Blessing said he spent his summer in the gym to make those changes. The result has been a lot of playing time as well as three goals and six assists.</p>
<p>“I’m pumped,” he said. “It’s been a good year so far and hopefully it keeps getting better.”</p>
<p>ASU&#8217;s fast start has earned it the No. 1 ranking among American Collegiate Hockey Association Division I teams. Its victories include a sweep last week of arch-rival Arizona at Oceanside Ice Arena.</p>
<p>Powers said the team had a lot of great players last season, and most of them were planning to return. In order for Blessing to keep his spot, he needed to make some changes.</p>
<p>“I told him, you have to come back in shape or maybe not be on the team,” Powers said. “So he did; he transformed mentally, physically, and now he’s a go-to guy.”</p>
<p>It was that transformation that Powers said made Blessing an inspiration to his teammates.</p>
<p>“Their elevated confidence in him and more respect for how he put in the work in the offseason has elevated his game and his approach to everything,” Powers said. <span class="soundcite" data-url="http://cronkitenews.asu.edu/assets/images/14/10/15-confidence.mp3" data-start="0" data-end="9000">listen</span></p>
<p>And even though Blessing doesn’t lead in any one area, Powers said it&#8217;s his overall attitude that makes him valuable.</p>
<p>“He was a great kid last year but now it’s really cool to see a kid with his approach and attitude and his work that he’s put in be rewarded,” Powers said. “It’s cliché, but hard work, it pays off and he’s proof of that.”</p>
<p>Blessing said part of his motivation to improve came from the camaraderie among players.</p>
<p>“You’re never going to find a sport where the guys are as close as hockey,” he said. “We’re all brothers, we all see each other as family, we all have each other’s back; It’s just a really cool thing to have.”</p>
<p>It’s this brotherhood that Blessing said has the team in the running for another championship, one that he plans to be more of a part of this time.</p>
<p>“We’re the king of the hill right now,” he said. “We got to keep playing, keep working and keep improving; we definitely have a shot.” <span class="soundcite" data-url="http://cronkitenews.asu.edu/assets/images/14/10/15-kingofhill.mp3" data-start="0" data-end="7000">listen</span></p>
