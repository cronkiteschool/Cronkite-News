      <div class="related_stories"><div class="glance_box_headline_in_page">Arizona's shortage:</div><div class="glance_box_in_page"><p>•Arizona ranks below the nations' average in primary health care professional shortages by nearly 10 percentage points.</p>
<p>• About half percent of the primary health care needs in Arizona are met.</p>
<p>• According to a study by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, Arizona would need 415 more primary health care professionals to remove the shortage designation.</p>
<p>• In 2010, Arizona ranked 43rd in nation for primary health care shortages, with 68 primary care physicians per 100,000 people.</p>
<p><i>Sources: <a href="http://www.kff.org/" target="_blank">kff.org</a>, <a href="http://futureofnursingaz.com/" target="_blank">futureofnursingaz.com</a></i></p>
</div></div><p>PHOENIX – Sarah Kellerhals, a second-year medical school student at University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix, says she always knew she wanted to be a primary care doctor rather than specializing in a more lucrative area such as cardiology.</p>
<p>“My parents were in the medical field; my dad was a physician’s assistant and my mom was a nurse, and I just kind of always was interested in medicine,” Kellerhals said.</p>
<p>When both of her parents were diagnosed with cancer within six months of each other while she was a pre-med undergraduate student, it only strengthened her passion for the field, she said.</p>
<p>“I wanted to know more about it, I wanted to learn more about the human body,” Kellerhals said. “I also really enjoyed taking care of them and helping them and I figured that medicine is a great way to continuing caring and helping people.”</p>
<p>Arizona doesn’t have enough primary care physicians to meet the need in many areas, particularly in rural and underserved parts of the state. According to a study by <a href="http://kff.org/other/state-indicator/primary-care-health-professional-shortage-areas-hpsas/">the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation</a> that also considered dentists and mental health professionals, only 53 percent of Arizona’s primary health care needs are being met.</p>
<p>To combat the problem, UA medical students held a Primary Care Week recently, offering speakers and events to promote the speciality of primary health care and address reservations students may have about entering the field.</p>
<p>Kellerhals, who helped organize the event, said primary care isn&#8217;t a popular choice among students these days, in large part because of lower salaries versus the high cost of attending medical school.</p>
<p>“Medical school is getting more and more expensive,” Kellerhals said.  “I do think that a fear that a lot of medical students have is being able to pay off their loans.”</p>
<p>Ana Roscetti, workforce section manager for the Arizona Department of Health Services, said loan-repayment options through the state and federal governments can make primary care more attractive for medical students.</p>
<p>The National Health Services Corps Loan Repayment Program primary care physicians, dentists and mental health professionals $50,000 in financial assistance annually. In exchange, they must sign a two-year contract with a clinic in an underserved area. Primary care professionals can choose to renew their contracts and receive funding until their student loans are paid in full.</p>
<p>The Arizona Loan Repayment Program is similar. Primary care professionals can receive up to $32,000-$40,000 for a two-year commitment, but they can only renew their contracts and receive financial assistance for four years.</p>
<p>&#8220;Loan-repayment programs are one of the approaches we are using to at least alleviate some of the burden of school loans for providers who are choosing to work as a primary care provider in a rural underserved community,” Roscetti said.</p>
<p>Kellerhals’ colleague, Alyssa Korenstein, said not making enough money as a &#8220;frontline physician&#8221; is a big misconception that primary care week addressed.</p>
<p>“Hopefully we can kind of raise awareness that you know, you’re not going to live in a cardboard box if you go into primary care,” Korenstein said.</p>
<p>Kellerhals said another reason why medical students are questioning the specialty of primary care is they view the field as dull.</p>
<p>“Some people want more high-intensity, short-term, and that is not necessarily what is always found in primary care, ” she said.</p>
<p>Another UA medical student, Megan Fah, said the need for primary care doctors is growing both locally and nationally.</p>
<p>“With the changes that have been made in health care, the Affordable Care Act, so many more people are now insured,” she said. “They need a doctor they need a family doc who they can see regularly, and it is a major problem that we have,” Fah said.</p>
<p>“It’s a great thing that we have so many thousands of patients who are now insured, but it’s a problem that we don’t have enough doctors,” she added.</p>
<p>Dr. Steven R. Brown, program director of Banner Good Samaritan Family Medicine Residency, said Arizona is ranked 43rd in the nation for primary care physicians per capita.</p>
<p>“We would need almost 2,000 more primary care physicians by 2030, which would be a 50 percent increase of what we have right now, just to maintain the current level or ratio of primary care physicians, which is already too low,” Brown said.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a shame, he said, because he loves working as a primary care physician.</p>
<p>“I work with the entire family, I deliver babies, work with old people, I work with pregnant women,” Brown said. “I take care of the patient that has the disease not the disease the patient has.”</p>
<p>And that is exactly the kind of experience that Kellerhals said she is looking for.</p>
<p>“I feel like I would do the most good in primary care because our country needs it, and that is where prevention starts,&#8221; she said.</p>
