<hr>
Shortly after a judge struck down Arizona's ban on same-sex marriage, the Maricopa County Superior Court Clerk's office issued new marriage licenses that added the option of "spouse" to "bride" and "groom."<br><br />
Maricopa County may have issued as many as 300 licenses to same-sex couples in the first two days after the ruling. But clerks in every county in the state said they had issued at least one so far.<br><br />
Click above to see a larger version of the Maricopa County application or click <a href="https://www.scribd.com/doc/243381434/New-Maricopa-Marriage-Certificate" target="_blank">here</a> for a look at the full application and license forms.</p>
<hr>
<h4><b>County counts:</b></h4>
<p>County clerks in Coconino, Maricopa, Pima, Yavapai and Yuma counties said they did not track the number of same-sex couples who took out marriage licenses, but all issued at least one - and perhaps hundreds for some. Licenses to same-sex couples as of Wednesday:</p>
<p>- Apache County, 1<br />
- Cochise County, 6<br />
- Gila County, 1<br />
- Graham County, 1<br />
- Greenlee County, 1<br />
- La Paz County, 1<br />
- Mohave County, 7<br />
- Navajo County, 1<br />
- Pinal County, 9<br />
- Santa Cruz County, 1</p>
</div></div><p><span style="font-size: 13px;">WASHINGTON &#8211; In the week since Arizona&#8217;s bans on same-sex marriage were overturned, clerks in all 15 of the state&#8217;s counties say they have issued at least one marriage license to same-sex couples.</span></p>
<p>Not all counties have kept track of licenses to same-sex as opposed to opposite-sex couples, but it appears that about 300 of the newly legal licenses had been issued in the first few days after the court ruling.</p>
<p>That means that state coffers have benefited along with same-sex couples: At $76 a pop, licenses to those couples had already brought in an estimated $20,000 or more in fees.</p>
<p>While the court ruling was a victory for gay-rights advocates, it was quickly attacked by groups like the Alliance Defending Freedom, which last week called it &#8220;a <a href="http://blog.alliancedefendingfreedom.org/2014/10/17/two-ways-we-should-not-respond-to-the-redefinition-of-marriage/" target="_blank">terrible decision</a>&#8221; that it vowed to fight.</p>
<p>One of its first post-ban actions was <a href="http://www.adfmedia.org/files/ArizonaClerksMemo.pdf" target="_blank">a memo</a> to county clerks throughout Arizona, telling them that they have the right to deny issuing licenses to same-sex couples for religious reasons and instructing them in how to do it.</p>
<p>But for the majority of clerks, the memo seems to have gone unheeded.</p>
<p>Evan Wolfson, president of the national marriage-equality organization Freedom to Marry, said he has &#8220;not heard of any clerk disrespecting their oath and their job duty&#8221; by refusing to issue a license.</p>
<p>Every county in Arizona has reported issuing at least one marriage license to a same-sex couple since the ban was overturned, though not all kept specific numbers.</p>
<p>Maricopa County officials, who said they issue 98 marriage licenses on an average day, issued 292 licenses last Friday and another 184 on Monday &#8211; a net increase of 280 licenses over the regular volume. They did not immediately have numbers for the rest of this week.</p>
<p>The Williams Institute, a California-based think tank, <a href="http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/AZ-Econ-Impact-June-2014.pdf" target="_blank">estimated</a> this summer that 7,909 same-sex couples would marry in Arizona in the first three years if the state&#8217;s ban was lifted. That would bring in more than $600,000 in license fees to the state if the numbers held true.</p>
<p>But the Williams Institute said the greater tax benefit would come from wedding spending by same-sex couples. Once taxes are collected on spending for wedding festivities, out-of-town guests and the like, the take could reach more than $5 million for the state over the three-year period, according its estimate.</p>
<p>The institute based its June estimate on 2010 Census data, the American Community Survey, and other data sources.</p>
<p>Last week&#8217;s ruling followed a rapid series of court decisions that have led to the legalization of same-sex marriage in more than 30 states so far.</p>
<p>On Oct. 6, the U.S. Supreme Court turned down appeals of five rulings from lower courts that had voided bans on same-sex marriage in different states. The next day, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned bans in Nevada and Idaho.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge John Sedwick cited the circuit court&#8217;s ruling &#8211; Arizona is in the 9th Circuit &#8211; and gave parties in two different cases challenging Arizona&#8217;s same-sex marriage bans several days to argue why he should not overturn the ban.</p>
<p>On Oct. 16, <a href="https://www.scribd.com/doc/243375766/Connolly-Et-Al-v-Brewer-Et-Al" target="_blank">he ruled</a> that an <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/FormatDocument.asp?inDoc=/const/30/1.htm" target="_blank">amendment</a> to the Arizona Constitution and <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/FormatDocument.asp?inDoc=/ars/25/00101.htm&amp;Title=25&amp;DocType=ARS" target="_blank">two</a> state laws <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/FormatDocument.asp?inDoc=/ars/25/00125.htm&amp;Title=25&amp;DocType=ARS" target="_blank">banning</a> same-sex marriage were unconstitutional violations of equal protection.</p>
<p>Arizona Attorney General Tom Horne said Oct. 17 that he disagreed with <a href="https://www.scribd.com/doc/243375519/Majors-v-Horne" target="_blank">the ruling</a> but would <a href="http://archive.azcentral.com/ic/pdf/horne-letter-clerk-court.pdf" target="_blank">not challenge</a> it, saying the higher courts&#8217; rulings made an appeal an &#8220;exercise in futility.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The only purpose served by filing another appeal would be to waste the taxpayer&#8217;s money,&#8221; Horne said then. &#8220;That is not a good conservative principle.&#8221;</p>
<p>Same-sex couples started heading to courthouses in Arizona to get married that afternoon.</p>
<p>While o Opponents have vowed to keep fighting, supporters say they are confident same-sex marriage in Arizona is here to stay.</p>
<p>&#8220;The gays aren&#8217;t using up all the marriage licenses,&#8221; Wolfson said. &#8220;There is plenty of room for marriage for all.&#8221;</p>
