      <div class="related_stories"><div class="glance_box_headline_in_page">Ladies first</div><div class="glance_box_in_page"><p>Women have had played a large part in Arizona for much of its history. Highlights from the past century include:</p>
<p>• 1912: Arizona becomes a state. The same year, men vote for women's suffrage in the general election - eight years before ratification of the 19th Amendment guaranteeing women the vote nationally.</p>
<p>• 1932: Arizona elects Rep. Isabella Selmes Greenway, the state's first congresswoman. She would go on to win re-election in 1934.</p>
<p>• 1981: Arizona native Sandra Day O'Connor becomes the first female justice to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
<p>• 1999: The "Fab Five" are sworn into office: Gov. Jane Dee Hull, Secretary of State Betsey Bayless, Attorney General Janet Napolitano, Superintendent of Public Instruction Lisa Graham Keegan and State Treasurer Carol Springer.</p>
<p>• 2012: Arizona tops the chart for smallest gender pay gap.</p>
</div></div><p><span style="font-size: 13px;">WASHINGTON &#8211; Arizona had the smallest gap between men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s pay among states in 2012, with women in the state earning about 87 cents to the dollar, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</span></p>
<p>Arizona trailed only the District of Columbia, where women earned about 95 cents to a man&#8217;s dollar, according <a href="http://www.bls.gov/cps/cpswom2012.pdf" target="_blank">the latest numbers</a> from BLS, which said women nationally averaged about 81 cents on the dollar. The biggest disparity was in Wyoming, where women earned 65 cents to each dollar earned by men.</p>
<p>President Barack Obama this week called on states, Congress and business leaders to adopt policies that close the gender pay gap. But analysts say Arizona&#8217;s pay equity is likely due to factors other than policy in a state that last actively considered equal pay legislation in the 1970s.</p>
<p>&#8220;Other states have definitely taken steps more recently,&#8221; said Kate Gallagher Robbins, senior policy analyst for the National <a href="http://www.nwlc.org/" target="_blank">Women&#8217;s Law Center</a>, pointing to states like New York and Vermont that considered equal pay bills within the last year.</p>
<p>In Arizona, experts said, the small earnings gap may have more to do with the state&#8217;s industrial mix, its demographics and generally lower overall incomes, among other factors.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s heartening to see that we figure well, but there are a lot of confounding factors,&#8221; said Sapna Gupta, senior policy analyst at Arizona State University&#8217;s <a href="http://morrisoninstitute.asu.edu/" target="_blank">Morrison Institute</a> for Public Policy. &#8220;There&#8217;s still a lot of progress to be made.&#8221;</p>
<p>She noted that Arizona&#8217;s median wage is still very low compared to other states. Arizona&#8217;s median weekly paycheck was $732, below the national average but above 15 other states. Women in the state had median income of $670 per week, compared to men&#8217;s $772.</p>
<p>Gupta said it will be interesting to watch Arizona&#8217;s gender pay gap as the state continues to recover from the recession and median weekly wages increase.</p>
<p>&#8220;As the wages go up, will the gap be closed?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;Will it narrow? Will it widen? Will it disappear?&#8221;</p>
<p>Another factor in the state&#8217;s relative pay equity is the <a href="http://morrisoninstitute.asu.edu/sites/default/files/content/products/AZD-2014_Looking Ahead.pdf" target="_blank">type of work</a> in Arizona, which has more service-based and less traditional and manufacturing jobs than the nation as a whole, she said.</p>
<p>That &#8220;industrial mix&#8221; argument was echoed by Dennis Hoffman, professor of economics at ASU&#8217;s W.P. <a href="http://wpcarey.asu.edu/" target="_blank">Carey School</a> of Business, who pointed to other possible reasons as well.</p>
<p>Hoffman said Arizona tends to have many low-wage construction jobs that are dominated by male workers and high-wage service jobs in the financial, health-care and education sectors that are dominated by women.</p>
<p>He added that Arizona, as a young state unencumbered by the &#8220;old boy&#8221; networks that may be found elsewhere, has no problem with women in leadership positions, in government or business.</p>
<p>&#8220;The last three governors have been women. You have women throughout state and local government,&#8221; Hoffman said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We embrace people for their productivity and their contributions to businesses and to the economy,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Perhaps we&#8217;re getting some reduction in gender pay gap from that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Progressive groups were pleased to see the narrow earning gap in Arizona, but agreed that the state&#8217;s pay equity probably comes from factors other than state policy.</p>
<p>&#8220;At a first glance, it seems great, but when you dig deeper you find that it may just be &#8230; the economy and the businesses that are in Arizona,&#8221; said Anna Chu, policy director for the ThinkProgress War Room at the Center for American Progress <a href="http://www.americanprogressaction.org/" target="_blank">Action Fund</a>.</p>
<p>In terms of policy, she said, Arizona is &#8220;not necessarily the state that comes to mind when we think of states have a progressive leaning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It has almost a libertarian leaning, rather than a traditionally progressive leaning,&#8221; Chu said.</p>
<p>But Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Phoenix, said she believes the state is very progressive &#8211; but after its own fashion.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s also a very progressive state, and I don&#8217;t mean in terms of political opinion left or right,&#8221; Sinema said of Arizona. &#8220;What I mean by progressive is that Arizonans are willing to do things that other states are not willing to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>She pointed to the state&#8217;s long history &#8220;of celebrating and recognizing the talents of women.&#8221; Sinema also cited the state&#8217;s voter-initiated clean-elections law, its legalization of medical marijuana and a ban on smoking in public places as examples of its willingness to break from convention.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a voting bloc, Arizonans are progressive in the sense &#8211; I mean that with a little &#8220;p&#8221; &#8211; that they&#8217;re willing to try new things,&#8221; she said.</p>
