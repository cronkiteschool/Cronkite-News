      <p><span style="font-size: 13px;">WASHINGTON &#8211; Arizona lawmakers and pro-life groups hailed Monday&#8217;s U.S. Supreme Court ruling that &#8220;closely held&#8221; businesses cannot be forced to provide certain contraceptives as part of health-care coverage for their employees.</span></p>
<p>But while supporters called the decision in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/13-354_olp1.pdf" target="_blank">Burwell v. Hobby Lobby</a> a &#8220;victory for religious freedom,&#8221; opponents countered that the 5-4 ruling by the court is &#8220;disrespectful and takes away from the religious rights of employees.&#8221;</p>
<p>Both sides agreed on one thing &#8211; this is likely not the end of the fight.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve lost the battle, but the war has just begun,&#8221; said Sarah Polk, a pro-choice protester who came from Texas to be on hand for Monday&#8217;s ruling.</p>
<p>The case involved Hobby Lobby stores and Conestoga Wood Specialties Corp., two family-run businesses that claimed the Affordable Care Act&#8217;s requirement that employers provide contraceptive coverage for employees conflicted with their &#8220;sincerely held&#8221; religious beliefs.</p>
<p>Specifically, the companies challenged the Obamacare requirement that workers have access to four forms of contraception that prevent the development of an embryo, which they said violated their opposition to abortion.</p>
<p>The court agreed, saying that while the government had an interest in requiring contraceptive coverage, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act required that it find the least-restrictive way to do so if that interest burdened a person&#8217;s free exercise of religion. The health care act overreaches, the court said.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are other ways in which Congress or HHS (the Department of Health and Human Services) could equally ensure that every woman has cost-free access to the particular contraceptives at issue here,&#8221; Justice Samuel Alito wrote for the court.</p>
<p>In a sharp dissent, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said the ruling of &#8220;startling breadth&#8221; would allow businesses to &#8220;opt out of any law (saving only tax laws) they judge incompatible with their sincerely held religious beliefs.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Alito, responding to charges that the ruling would let businesses engage in discriminatory practices or refuse to provide immunizations under the guise of religion, said the decision &#8220;provides no such shield.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our decision in these cases is concerned solely with the contraceptive mandate,&#8221; Alito wrote.</p>
<p>But Bryan Howard, president of <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/planned-parenthood-arizona/" target="_blank">Planned Parenthood</a> Arizona, called the ruling &#8220;absolutely unbelievable.&#8221; He said the decision is a &#8220;violation, disrespectful and takes away from the religious rights of employees.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are allowing a very small group of wealthy business owners decide what&#8217;s best for people they don&#8217;t even know,&#8221; Howard said. &#8220;If businesses are entitled to the protection their religious beliefs, then so should their employees.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Dorinda Bordlee, senior counsel for the Scottsdale-based <a href="http://bdfund.org/" target="_blank">Bioethics Defense Fund</a>, called it a &#8220;huge victory for family-run business everywhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve stopped the government from bullying the little guy and preventing them from running businesses how they chose to, religion aside,&#8221; said Bordlee, whos groups filed friend-of-the-court briefs in support of Hobby Lobby.</p>
<p>The ruling was praised by Sen. John <a href="http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publications/supreme_court_preview/briefs-v3/13-354-13-356_amcu_senators.authcheckdam.pdf" target="_blank">McCain</a>, R-Ariz., one of several state lawmakers &#8211; along with Attorney General Tom <a href="http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publications/supreme_court_preview/briefs-v3/13-354-13-356_amcu_som.authcheckdam.pdf" target="_blank">Horne</a> and Rep. Trent <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/13-354-bsac-Members-of-Congress.pdf" target="_blank">Franks</a>, R-Glendale &#8211; who signed on to friend-of-the-court briefs in support of Hobby Lobby. In a prepared statement, McCain called the ruling <span style="font-size: 13px;">a &#8220;victory for religious freedom and individual liberty in the face of big-government mandates.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Kristina Arriaga, executive director of the the </span><a style="font-size: 13px;" href="http://www.becketfund.org/" target="_blank">Becket Fund</a><span style="font-size: 13px;"> for Religious Liberty, which represented Hobby Lobby, said there&#8217;s a reason freedom of religion &#8220;is the First Amendment, not 14th or the Ninth.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Because it is the most important protection our government gives to its citizens, and employers should be given the same freedom,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>But Rep. Raul <a href="http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publications/supreme_court_preview/briefs-v3/13-354-13-356_amcu_ushr.authcheckdam.pdf" target="_blank">Grijalva</a>, D-Tucson, who joined in brief opposing Hobby Lobby, said in a joint statement with Progressive Caucus co-chair Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minn., that the ruling was a &#8220;step backwards for women&#8217;s rights in America.&#8221;</p>
<p>Outside the court Monday, where hundreds of protesters gathered for the decision, opinions were just as divided.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s unfair and it&#8217;s unjust,&#8221; said Polk after the ruling, pausing between chants she was shouting into a makeshift megaphone. &#8220;This is a war on women, for our rights, and they can&#8217;t be taken away from us because of someone else&#8217;s religious belief.&#8221;</p>
<p>But as pro-life groups flooded the plaza in front the court, Missy Martinez, a &#8220;very proud&#8221; member of Students for Life of America said she could not have been happier about the decision.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a country we bend over backwards every day to protect religious freedom, then it comes to birth control and all of a sudden everything&#8217;s different?,&#8221; said Martinez. &#8220;There&#8217;s nothing fair or equal about that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you want birth control, do what you&#8217;ve got to do,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But don&#8217;t impose on people&#8217;s religion. I feel more equal and more protected by our government than ever before.&#8221;</p>
<p>Martinez said both sides were fighting for women, even though their means were different.</p>
<p>But Howard said the Hobby Lobby ruling would deny women &#8220;a fundamental right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m extremely certain that that this will give employers a way to discriminate against women,&#8221; Howard said. &#8220;Men and women do not require the same types of regular medical care and this is denying women their fundamental right to health care.&#8221;</p>
