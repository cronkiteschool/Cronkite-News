</div></div><p><span style="font-size: 13px;">WASHINGTON &#8211; Things looked bad in January when Mikayla Perez, a Tucson teen with lupus, lost her health coverage after the state of Arizona canceled KidsCare II, part of its children&#8217;s health insurance program.</span></p>
<p>And things were about to get worse.</p>
<p>Dropped from the <a href="http://www.azahcccs.gov/publicnotices/Downloads/KidsCareCoverage.pdf" target="_blank">state plan</a> for low-income kids, the Perezes learned they made too much money to qualify for the state&#8217;s Medicaid program, which had picked up about 23,000 KidsCare II kids.</p>
<p>Insurance for the whole family through father Frank&#8217;s workplace was too expensive. But because he had a plan at work, a wrinkle in the Affordable Care Act put coverage under Obamacare similarly out of reach.</p>
<p>So Frank chose to cut his pay this year so the family could come in under the state&#8217;s Medicaid income limits &#8211; only to have their paperwork botched twice by the state.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s devastating for us,&#8221; said Mikayla&#8217;s mother, Carla. &#8220;It&#8217;s devastating when she says she doesn&#8217;t feel good and we don&#8217;t know what to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>So they kept trying, in hopes of getting their daughter &#8220;affordable&#8221; care.</p>
<p>That care finally arrived last week, when the family got a letter saying they had been enrolled in the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System &#8211; the state&#8217;s version of Medicaid. But not before months of work and worry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Really, we just need to worry about between now and then,&#8221; Carla said, before the <a href="http://www.azahcccs.gov/" target="_blank">AHCCCS</a> enrollment was approved. &#8220;But that&#8217;s a big worry if she has to go into the hospital every few months.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mikayla was diagnosed at age 16 with lupus, a systemic autoimmune disease that attacks her joints and tissues. Now 17, she takes 10 different prescriptions every day to help keep the symptoms of lupus in check &#8211; a few for the pain, one for her stomach, a dose of steroids to keep her strong.</p>
<p>Ten pills in the morning. Another set of four pills at night.</p>
<p>&#8220;I used to be afraid of taking pills, so I would only take one at a time. But with this whole thing, I&#8217;m able to take a big handful of pills and just throw them in my mouth and take them all at once,&#8221; she joked.</p>
<p>But without all those medications, Mikayla could end up in the hospital, like she did in early April after attending a church campfire.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe once every two months she&#8217;ll have a morning that she forgets to take her pills, and the next day she pays the price for it. She&#8217;s so sick,&#8221; Carla said. &#8220;For her to even go two or three days without it, it can&#8217;t happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Affording Mikayla&#8217;s prescriptions has been a struggle since she was dropped from <a href="http://www.azahcccs.gov/applicants/categories/KidsCare.aspx" target="_blank">KidsCare</a>, which had a monthly premium but no other costs. Medicaid, now that they are enrolled, will cover her prescriptions; plans they might get through Obamacare might not.</p>
<p>Joe Fu, health policy director for the Children&#8217;s Action Alliance, said the Arizona child advocacy group helped research the impact of moving kids with different health statuses from KidsCare to the federal marketplace. The findings of <a href="http://ccf.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Dismantling-CHIP-in-Arizona.pdf" target="_blank">that research</a>, released Thursday with the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families, said that even without factoring in premiums, the cost-sharing alone in federal marketplace plans make them more expensive than KidsCare in nearly all cases.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of these families and kids are going to experience a huge cost difference between their KidsCare plans and marketplace plans, if they do choose to go that route,&#8221; Fu said. &#8220;The co-pays, the coinsurance costs, the medication costs, all of those things are going to add up really quickly for these families.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even if they could afford an Obamacare plan, the Perezes quickly learned that that was not an option.</p>
<p>&#8220;They keep telling me, &#8216;Go through <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/" target="_blank">the marketplace</a>,&#8217;&#8221; said Carla. &#8220;Everyone. I try to talk to people. &#8216;Go to the marketplace. Go to the marketplace&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been to the marketplace. &#8230; I applied on the marketplace and they denied us the subsidies because my husband has insurance through his work.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Perezes have been caught by what experts call the &#8220;family glitch.&#8221; Designed to keep workers from ditching employer-provided health insurance for federally subsidized marketplace plans, the Affordable Care Act requires employees to keep &#8220;affordable&#8221; workplace plans &#8211; costing no more than 9.5 percent of income &#8211; or forfeit subsidies that would make marketplace plans cheaper.</p>
<p>But the law did not account for families, said Bruce Lesley, president of First Focus, a child advocacy group based in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>&#8220;The cost for a family plan could be triple or more of that of the employee,&#8221; Lesley said. &#8220;So it may only be 8 percent of income for the employee, but it could be more than 25 percent of their income for a family, which makes it unaffordable.&#8221;</p>
<p>The glitch has affected families nationwide, but may be made worse in Arizona because of the state&#8217;s frozen children&#8217;s health insurance program, experts said.</p>
<p>For the Perez family, putting Mikayla on her dad&#8217;s workplace insurance would add almost $200 to the monthly premiums that they already pay.</p>
<p>Mikayla should be getting her blood work done on a monthly basis, along with regularly visiting a rheumatologist. But since she was dropped from KidsCare, she has only been to the doctor once &#8211; an emergency room visit in April after the church campfire.</p>
<p>&#8220;So we sit here with a chronically ill child. If she was a normal teenager and just needed her yearly physical, the marketplace would be perfect,&#8221; Carla said. &#8220;But when you get through making all the co-pays, and paying for the policies, we can&#8217;t afford it. And that&#8217;s the bottom line.&#8221;</p>
<p>Carla remembers being excited when the Affordable Care Act passed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I told my husband, &#8216;We&#8217;re finally going to be able to have insurance,&#8217;&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Carla still supports the law, but she doesn&#8217;t think every situation was considered when it was passed.</p>
<p>For a family excluded from Obamacare, the barrage of health care advocates pushing the plan has become a constant reminder of what they can&#8217;t have.</p>
<p>&#8220;All I hear is, &#8216;Go to the marketplace.&#8217; And I hate hearing those words,&#8221; Carla said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t even answer my phone. I get constant calls from health agents and health representatives, and I don&#8217;t even answer them,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I get stuff in the mail and I just tear them up and throw them away.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Perezes thought they had a solution when Frank cut his hourly wages as a painter so they could apply to AHCCCS.</p>
<p>But while Mikayla was in the hospital in April, Carla found out that AHCCCS had denied them coverage because it didn&#8217;t have all their paperwork. She raced home to resubmit the application, including a new pay stub reflecting Frank&#8217;s lower wages. In mid-April, the family was denied again &#8211; for making too much money, even though Carla had turned in paperwork showing the lower income.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody at the AHCCCS office ever bothered, in the last two applications that we filled out, to look at the downloads that they had to have, supposedly,&#8221; Carla said. &#8220;They just went by his old income, and they denied us twice.&#8221;</p>
<p>An AHCCCS spokeswoman blamed the family&#8217;s denial on a simple computational error that has since been corrected. The agency has since worked directly with the family to get them enrolled.</p>
<p>&#8220;It just captured the previous income information rather than the new income change that they reported,&#8221; said Jennifer Carusetta, chief legislative liaison for AHCCCS. She added that applicants are &#8220;always welcome&#8221; to notify AHCCCS if they believe they were wrongly denied.</p>
<p>That was not exactly at the top of the daily to-do list for the Perez family. Neither was battling glitches in the Affordable Care Act.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel like I&#8217;m a puppet. And if I don&#8217;t stay on top of this and constantly call them and constantly pursue this, they don&#8217;t care,&#8221; Carla said. &#8220;Yeah, we can go to the marketplace, but those of us that have the chronically ill (children) and the children that are dying, that doesn&#8217;t help us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Carla said this week that she was glad her family&#8217;s situation was resolved, but she still plans to push the state to re-implement KidsCare.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad they have the AHCCCS program, but I really want to fight to get the KidsCare program back,&#8221; Carla said. &#8220;That&#8217;s what this is about, really.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mikayla said she&#8217;s ready to join that fight, to help other kids.</p>
<p>&#8220;This wasn&#8217;t all supposed to be about my problems. I wanted it to be about the other kids, too,&#8221; Mikayla chimed in. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad that my mom is still pushing for them, and I&#8217;ll be by her side if she needs me.&#8221;</p>
