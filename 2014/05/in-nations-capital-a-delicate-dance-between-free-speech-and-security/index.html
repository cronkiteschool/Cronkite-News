      <p><span style="font-size: 13px;">WASHINGTON &#8211; Gerardo Torres had every intention of getting arrested at the White House, but he was still a little nervous &#8211; the immigration activist said previous arrests at protests in other cities had been &#8220;a little rough.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But when I was in D.C., it was less trouble,&#8221; said the Phoenix resident, who was surprised by his &#8220;gentle and peaceful&#8221; February arrest on the sidewalk in front of White House.</p>
<p>U.S. Park Police stood by as Torres and dozens of others gathered on the sidewalk to speak, wave signs and chant, &#8220;Not one more deportation,&#8221; for an audience of supporters, journalists and gawking tourists.</p>
<p>After about 10 minutes, police moved the media a short distance away and began to issue warnings every few minutes that protesting on the sidewalk in front of the White House was illegal. A couple warnings later, they confiscated the protesters&#8217; signs, put them in plastic handcuffs and walked them to a waiting police van.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a process that one sociologist calls &#8220;negotiated management&#8221; of protests, as authorities try to balance protesters&#8217; First Amendment rights with officers&#8217; duty to uphold the law. And in Washington, that balancing act is played out regularly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure exactly how other places deal with protests, but I know we have way more of them around here and we have to act accordingly,&#8221; said Officer Shennell Antrobus, a spokesman for the U.S. Capitol Police, one of several police agencies in the city that could be called on to respond to a protest. Capitol Police were not involved in Torres&#8217; White House arrest.</p>
<p>Antrobus said the high volume of protests in Washington led Capitol Police to establish a <a href="http://www.uscapitolpolice.gov/special_events.php" target="_blank">Special Events Unit</a>, whose main job is to &#8220;enforce the law while also allowing people to express their First Amendment rights.&#8221; He said the unit works to document who the protesters are and why they are in the capital, and establish the exact parameters of where they can protest.</p>
<p>Neither Antrobus nor Torres would discuss details of what goes into the negotiations over a protest or who knows what beforehand. But one veteran protester said that in his experience there are typically few surprises.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been through the protest permit process a few times in D.C. and I can tell you there is a plan,&#8221; said Paul Magno, a business manager for <a href="http://nonviolenceinternational.net/" target="_blank">Nonviolence International</a>, a social change and international peace organization.</p>
<p>&#8220;Authorities have asked us ahead of time how many of us plan to get arrested,&#8221; Magno said. &#8220;We would tell them and they would order a number of officers on the scene to match our answer.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.uidaho.edu/class/socanthro/patrickgillham" target="_blank">Patrick Gillham</a>, a University of Idaho sociology professor, said that type of protest coordination &#8220;began in the late &#8217;70s and early &#8217;80s from the D.C. area and has spread out to other cities.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We call this era &#8216;negotiated management&#8217; because of the rise of using permits and paperwork as part of the protesting process,&#8221; Gillham said. &#8220;The process can involve regulations for necessary facilities and resources.&#8221;</p>
<p>If a protest is big enough, for example, certain cities may require that protesters to provide portable toilets to accommodate the crowds. Representatives of the protest may be required to purchase a bond or insurance in case there is any damage from the crowds.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are situations where if people don&#8217;t have the money to pay for the requirements, it will really limit how they can protest,&#8221; Gillham said.</p>
<p>Magno said that the coming together of authorities and protestors helps to keep the peace. And he sees no problem with police standing by during a peaceful protest.</p>
<p>&#8220;They can&#8217;t arrest us for something nonviolent that we haven&#8217;t done yet,&#8221; Magno said. &#8220;They are perfectly in their rights to let these things play out.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Gillham says change could possibly be on the horizon, noting recent protests by groups like the Occupy Movement.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are seeing a transition into what we call &#8216;<a href="http://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/gillham/research/Strategic Incapacitation and Policing of OWS_FINAL1.pdf" target="_blank">strategic incapacitation</a>&#8216;,&#8221; Gillham said. &#8220;In recent years some protest movements like Occupy have been ignoring the permit process and that has some law enforcement changing their approach.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gillham said an out-of-control protest may now be counted as &#8220;civil unrest,&#8221; allowing departments to request &#8211; and officers to use &#8211; crowd-control devices, from pepper spray to body armor. For the most part, however, he said interactions between police and protesters are still peaceful and accommodating.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s good for both sides, Antrobus said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we are building a lot of good understanding in the community,&#8221; he said. &#8220;People are gaining a better understanding of protesters&#8217; views, and people are getting a better view of law enforcement.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was good for Torres, too.</p>
<p>Six hours after he was arrested in the National Day Laborer&#8217;s Organizing Network protest at the White House, he was released from custody without so much as giving officials any of his personal information.</p>
