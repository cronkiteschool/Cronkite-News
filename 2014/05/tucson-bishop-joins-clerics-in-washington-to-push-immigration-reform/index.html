      <p><span style="font-size: 13px;">WASHINGTON &#8211; Tucson Bishop Gerald Kicanas believes there is &#8220;still a glimmer of hope&#8221; for immigration reform this year, a message he and other bishops tried to deliver to Congress Thursday.</span></p>
<p>Kicanas joined five clerics from the U.S. Conference of <a href="http://www.usccb.org/about/migration-and-refugee-services/" target="_blank">Catholic Bishops</a> to celebrate a Mass on Capitol Hill before they fanned out to meet members of the House, where immigration reform has been stalled for almost a year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our hope in Washington is to press Congress to see this as something that needs attention,&#8221; Kicanas said. &#8220;The system is broken and we have the means to fix it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Capitol Hill visits come two months after a group of bishops celebrated a Mass at the U.S.-Mexico border, part of several days on the border that included a trek through the desert and visits with immigrants and Border Patrol agents in Nogales.</p>
<p>The clerics hoped to bring the spirit of that border visit to their meetings in Washington.</p>
<p>&#8220;We hope that Congress will address immigration reform now, in this session, and not kick the can down the road,&#8221; said Miami Archbishop Thomas Wenski at a news conference after the Mass.</p>
<p>With little time left before Congress&#8217; August recess, however, and a November election looming, few think there is the time or will to pass immigration reform.</p>
<p>The Senate passed a comprehensive immigration <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-113s744es/pdf/BILLS-113s744es.pdf" target="_blank">reform bill</a> last June, but the House has yet to act on that bill &#8211; or on any of several immigration reform bills proposed by House members.</p>
<p>House Speaker John Boehner has said that the U.S. needs immigration reform. &#8220;It&#8217;s good for our country, and frankly it&#8217;s the right thing to do,&#8221; the Ohio Republican said last summer.</p>
<p>But he has said repeatedly that the House will not be rushed in to considering the Senate&#8217;s bill. In February, <a href="http://www.speaker.gov/video/speaker-boehner-s-comments-immigration-reform" target="_blank">Boehner said</a> the House would take a &#8220;step-by-step, common-sense approach to this is so we can build trust with the American people that we&#8217;re doing this the right way.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bishops met with Boehner Thursday, urging him to address immigration reform in the current session of Congress. The speaker&#8217;s office declined comment on the meeting, but Kicanas said it was cordial.</p>
<p>&#8220;Speaker Boehner was very clear in saying he does want to get this done, he does need to continue to work with his Republican caucus to find a way to address this issue in the most effective way possible, but there are challenges,&#8221; Kicanas said.</p>
<p>Kicanas also met with members of Arizona&#8217;s congressional delegation, including Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Prescott, and Democratic Reps. Ann Kirkpatrick of Flagstaff, and Ron Barber and Raul Grijalva of Tucson.</p>
<p>Kirkpatrick said she thinks efforts like those of the bishops make a difference.</p>
<p>&#8220;The bishop is very well-versed in the economic benefits of doing this as well as the moral benefits, because lack of immigration reform is tearing families apart,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Kirkpatrick also said she believes that there are enough votes to pass immigration reform in the House if leaders would bring it up for a vote.</p>
<p>One of the reasons she initially ran for Congress was to pass immigration reform, she said, after being frustrated with the &#8220;piecemeal state-by-state attempts to solve the problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It has to be done at the federal level,&#8221; Kirkpatrick said. &#8220;It&#8217;s disappointing to me that we have not already gotten this done.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kicanas said he hoped the face-to-face meetings could help get it done.</p>
<p>&#8220;What I&#8217;ve experienced in Arizona is that when someone meets a migrant, hears their story, listens to their struggle, it has an incredibly powerful effect on changing attitudes,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I hope today in meeting with our legislators to try to bring the face of the migrant that we have met in Arizona.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kicanas called the day of meetings at the Capitol &#8220;a good day, hopefully a day that will lead to some resolution to the situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Kicanas said he still believes there is time to act.</p>
<p>&#8220;While some may say it&#8217;s a dead issue this year, there is still a glimmer of hope,&#8221; he said.</p>
